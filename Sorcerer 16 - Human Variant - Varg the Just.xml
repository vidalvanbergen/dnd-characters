Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that&#39;s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.

This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.

Cantrips:
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

Sorcery Points:
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

Flexible Casting:
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.

Creating Spell Slots:
You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. It costs 2 sorcery points to create a 1st level spell slot, 3 to create a 2nd level slot, 5 for a 3rd level slot, 6 for a 4th level slot, or 7 for a 5th level slot. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god&#39;s name.

Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

But while some spellcasters must study the essence and nature of magic in the hope of learning to harness it, sorcerers possess an innate talent to sculpt and wield the errant strands of power that shape the world. For some sorcerers, the body becomes a conduit for this power, which is collected and stored in the form of natural runes—and which sees a sorcerer named as a Runechild.

The talents of a Runechild are rare, and sorcerers with this origin are sought after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that the secrets of their runes can help understand the mysteries of magic. Others sometimes seek to enslave Runechild sorcerers, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for diabolic pursuits. Runechild sorcerers were subjugated throughout the Age of Arcanum, and many of their contemporaries now search for ways to hide their essence—a task that isn&#39;t easy given the revealing nature of their gifts.

And in communities that survive Far Realm incursions, some folk are mutated into horrific aberrations, while a lucky few not only remain themselves, but also discover that psionic energy now suffuses their minds.

As a Psionic Soul sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them, and did they manifest throughout childhood? Or did an extraordinary event later in life leave you shining with psionic awareness? Consult the Psionic Origins table for a possible origin of your power.

Psionic Origins:
d10 — Origin
1 — You were exposed to the Far Realm&#39;s warping influence. You can now use your mind in ways you never thought possible, and you&#39;re also convinced that a tendril is growing upon you.
2 — A psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy into your being. When you use your powers now, faint motes of light sparkle around you.
3 — You or your ancestor were trained by a githzerai monk to unlock the psionic potential within yourself.
4 — A spirit haunts your mind, lending incredible power to your thoughts. When you sleep, the spirit&#39;s memories invade your dreams.
5 — Deep in a forest touched by the Feywild, you drank from a glimmering stream, and now your mind shines with power. Beasts and fey creatures are often now friendly to you, as if they can sense the light within you.
6 — Upon recovering from a near-fatal injury, you found yourself with psionic powers. Whenever you use them, your old wound tingles.
7 — You were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but the ceremorphosis never completed. And now the psionic power is yours. When you use it, your flesh shines with a strange mucus.
8 — As a child, you had an imaginary friend that looked like a flumph or a strange platypuslike creature. One day, it gifted you with psionic powers, which have ended up being not so imaginary.

You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6.

Psionic Talent Options
You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:

Psionic Discovery.
You can unlock the ability to cast a mind-oriented sorcerer spell you don&#39;t already know. After meditating for 10 minutes (which can be done during a rest), roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose a sorcerer spell of a level for which you have spell slots and that is in the school of divination or enchantment. You know the chosen spell for a number of hours equal to the number you rolled.

Psychic Sorcery.
When you cast a spell, you can use your mind to form it, rather than relying on words, gestures, and materials. To do so, roll your Psionic Talent die. The spell then requires no verbal component, and if you rolled the level of the spell or higher, the spell doesn&#39;t require somatic or material components either.

Telepathic Speech.
You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see, and roll your Psionic Talent die. For a number of hours equal to the number you rolled, you and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to the number you rolled. To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows. The telepathic connection ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.


Changing the Die&#39;s Size
If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it&#39;s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.

Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.

Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

Psi Replenishment
As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can&#39;t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.

You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix&#39;s power dwells within you.

That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can&#39;t bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.

More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.

Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.

Phoenix Soul Quirks:
d6 — Phoenix Soul
1 — You absentmindedly ignite small fires that quickly sputter out.
2 — You cackle like a fiend when you unleash your fire spells.
3 — You admire fire, even if it burns your friends.
4 — You are covered in burns that mark the first time your power manifested.

At 18th level, you become the focal point of a reality-warping anomaly. As an action, you can magically radiate a transparent, 20-foot-radius aura for 1 minute. This might take the form of a sphere of rippling psychic energy, a fluctuating amoebic gel, an extrusion of ephemeral parasites, or some other manifestation. Other creatures treat the aura as difficult terrain, and when they start their turn in it, they take 2d10 psychic damage. When you activate this feature, you can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the aura.

As a bonus action, you can end the aura early. If you do so, you and any number of creatures you choose within the aura are teleported to a location you can see within 1 mile of you. Each creature must appear within 20 feet of you and in an unoccupied space. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC is not teleported. Once you use this feature, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a long rest.

The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you&#39;re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane.

While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as &#34;Attack that creature,&#34; &#34;Run over there,&#34; or &#34;Fetch that object.&#34; If the creature completes the order and doesn&#39;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn&#39;t do anything that you don&#39;t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can&#39;t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.

You create one of the following magical effects within range:

	• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
	• You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
	• You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
	• You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
	• You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
	• You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can&#39;t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

You&#39;ve witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places where you don&#39;t know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of the wild.

</text></feat><feat><name>Suggested Characteristics</name><text>Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities.

d8 — Personality Trait
1 — I&#39;m driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
2 — I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
3 — I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I&#39;d do it again if I had to.
4 — I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
5 — I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won&#39;t save you from a hungry owlbear.
6 — I&#39;m always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.
7 — I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
8 — I was, in fact, raised by wolves.

d6 — Ideal
1 — Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)
2 — Greater Good. It is each person&#39;s responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Good)
3 — Honor. If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. (Lawful)
4 — Might. The strongest are meant to rule. (Evil)
5 — Nature. The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral)
6 — Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)

d6 — Bond
1 — My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
2 — An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
3 — I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.
4 — I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.
5 — I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
6 — It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.

d6 — Flaw
1 — I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
2 — There&#39;s no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
3 — I remember every insult I&#39;ve received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who&#39;s ever wronged me.
4 — I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
5 — Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
6 — Don&#39;t expect me to save those who can&#39;t save themselves. It is nature&#39;s way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.

	• Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• You learn the misty step spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the divination or enchantment school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can&#39;t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells&#39; spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

	• You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.

	• You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.

	• When a hostile creature&#39;s movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.

You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&#39;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#39;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&#39;t attack a target beyond the weapon&#39;s long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, dagger
