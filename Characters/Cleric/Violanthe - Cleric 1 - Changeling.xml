Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.
	The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.
	In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.
	Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona&#39;s previous users.

Cantrips:
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

Preparing and Casting Spells:
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#39;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus

	Spell attack modifier = Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Ritual Casting:
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a cleric.

	• Wisdom 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class&#39;s starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a cleric.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: none
	• Tools: none

Source:	Player&#39;s Handbook (2014) p. 163</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Multiclass Features</name><text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don&#39;t, however, receive the class&#39;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you&#39;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn&#39;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don&#39;t add together. You can&#39;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter&#39;s version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock&#39;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn&#39;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can&#39;t gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don&#39;t have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don&#39;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and WeeJas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the underworld (Hades and Hel).

The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.

As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn&#39;t behind total cover and that isn&#39;t protected from divination magic. This sense doesn&#39;t tell you anything about a creature&#39;s capabilities or identity.

Source:	Xanathar&#39;s Guide to Everything p. 20</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Divine Domain: Order Domain</name><text>The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Wee Jas, Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.
	The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action&#39;s results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.
	Law establishes hierarchies: Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.
	Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics&#39; blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another&#39;s burdens, and the clerics&#39; magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your proficiency bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn.

The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night.
	Clerics who serve these deities-examples of which appear on the Twilight Deities table-bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

You have darkvision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.
	As an action, you can magically share the darkvision of this feature with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). The shared darkvision lasts for 1 hour. Once you share it, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to share it again.

Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.
	The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and WeeJas of Greyhawk.

Those who take up this domain understand that the power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit&#39;s anchor within the mortal shell.
	Gods who grant the power of the Blood Domain, including the Ruiner and the Matron of Ravens, direct their followers to tap into the connection between body and soul, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one&#39;s own vitality, and corrupt the bodies of others through the secret rites of hemocraft. Clerics of good gods use hemocraft to fill their self-sacrifice with purpose and power, while clerics with fewer morals use the blood of others to achieve their own malevolent ends.

The Moonweaver herself is said to guide her worshipers from within the pale glow of Catha, revealing hidden paths and granting inspired dreams to those who pray to that moon. Distant, dark Ruidus is often regarded with awe and apprehension, considered a portent for fell deeds and bad luck.
	Clerics of the Moon Domain draw on their divine connection to the moons to wield light and shadow, invoke good fortune and ill favor, and reveal or conceal as they see fit. Most Moon clerics worship the Moonweaver herself, but her followers are as varied as the stars in the sky. Some seek to protect the vulnerable and do good in the world, while others meddle with impunity and distort the truth for selfish gain. Other Moon clerics worship not the gods but the moons themselves, especially those with an innate connection to the lunar cycles through lycanthropy.

These are the ties of family and friendship, the ties to ancestors, as well as the ties between elders and the next generation with whom they share their wisdom. The power of the Gods of community is in the security of home and hearth, and the joy of good company. Many such gods teach the value of tradition and simple ways of living in harmony with the natural world. They also tend towards the rule of law, not as a kind of great bureaucracy, but as sacred traditions passed from generation to generation. Some gods advocate the removal of harsh or disruptive forces to this order, and proper sanctions for the violation of the goodwill that any community ought to provide.

The gods of night are varied, encompassing those who would use the cover of darkness to protect others from threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings. The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery. Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one can attain truth.

They are adept at finding their prey and, once located, use their magic to ensure they are never outrun.

Bontu has fully embraced this dictum, and though she expends little effort in teaching it, she surely leads by example. Her viziers subtly plant the seeds that flower into the ambition the God-Pharaoh desires. Through insinuation, they remind acolytes and initiates alike that achieving one&#39;s place in the afterlife at the expense of others is not shameful, but is proof of the initiate&#39;s determination and drive. Nothing is more important than that drive, they suggest—not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love. Not even devotion to a deity.

Kefnet&#39;s task is to pass on this teaching of the God-Pharaoh and elucidate its meaning. He teaches that the afterlife will be inhabited only by those who have proved by their wits that they are worthy of dwelling in the glorious presence of the God-Pharaoh. He trains acolytes and initiates to push their limits and challenge their mental capacity with spells of ever-greater power.

Kefnet&#39;s domain is identical to the Knowledge domain in the Player&#39;s Handbook.

Oketra is charged with expounding upon this teaching of the God-Pharaoh, instilling in every initiate the virtue of solidarity. She forges each group of children into a crop of acolytes with just one purpose: to be judged worthy of a glorious afterlife. And she instills in each crop the ability to unite in a single action in pursuit of that purpose. She is fond of poetic imagery to communicate her ideals.

It falls to Rhonas to instill this teaching in those who would enter the afterlife—but to his mind, the words themselves don&#39;t matter. Strength can&#39;t be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students any kind of academic instruction. He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. He invites them to scrutinize every move and practice what they see.

However, all faiths have rules, acts which are seen as taboo and creatures declared anathema. When violations appear, the inquisitors follow, finding the violators and enforcing the law with divine wrath and the point of a sword.
	Inquisitors bring safety to some, but are often fearsome figures in their work. At their best, they protect their communities from corrupting influences of cults, undead, and creatures from the outer planes. At their worst, they are tyrants, leading reigns of terror to quash dissent and oppress those who do not share their faiths.
	Inquisitors exist throughout the multiverse, serving causes both good and evil. On many planes, the church of Lolth makes extensive use of them to root out dissent among the drow, and inquisitors of Bahamut are tasked with finding and quashing cults in service of Tiamat. In Faerun, Helm&#39;s eternal quest to protect his servants draws many inquisitors, and the efforts of Bane&#39;s followers to establish dominion over regions they control encourages many onto the path of the inquisitor as well. In Eberron, Thrane&#39;s Church of the Silver Flame and the secret police of Zilargo include many inquisitors among their ranks. Inquisitors abound among the clerics of Ravenloft, given the predominance of malign entities to be fought, corrupt cults to be stopped, and overbearing tyrants to be served.

While altering Fate is incredibly beneficial, it sometimes comes at a price.
	The eyes of a Seer can view the threads of magic that weave between creatures and places. They are often wise beyond their intelligence as their patron nudges them forward like the guiding hands of fortune.
	Seers are perfect for players who want to have more of a support role, using premonitions in order to aid their allies in battle. These clerics could be randomly chosen by gods who deem them vital to history and fate, or simply fortune tellers whose fortunes were heard by powerful ears.

Their decision-making reflects this spirit, using luck and randomness to determine the optimal course of action in uncertain situations. It&#39;s not unusual for a cleric of chaos to cast lots when concrete evidence is lacking, acknowledging the futility of controlling chance and fully accepting it.
	These clerics maintain that unpredictability is the only constant and that excessive reliance on laws and order stifles progress. They consider hierarchy limiting, as it constrains individuals and favors those in power. They believe natural chaos enables creatures to unveil their true selves and achieve their potential through self-responsibility.
	Windspeaker clerics of chaos honor Tamera and Bauron, the dual deities, by accepting the unpredictable and leaving matters to chance. They assert the world was born from the fusion of these conflicting natures, creating chaos. Conversely, clerics of chaos devoted to Ba-Ka, the Spirit God of Magic, laud the deity&#39;s endorsement of magic in all its forms. They value that Chaos domain clerics can use magic from other domains, crediting this to Ba-Ka&#39;s influence. These clerics see the extensive and intricate power of magic as irrefutable evidence of chaos&#39;s potency, as magic transforms the world&#39;s structure and rules.
	The Evolutionist Church previously harbored clerics of chaos who considered Bauron a God of Chaos. However, recent revelations from angels exposed the Ungods&#39; manipulation of sacred scriptures. Now recognizing Bauron as a law-abiding god of punishment, these clerics have either amended their views or left the church to pursue new life paths.

In Other Settings:
Clerics in this domain associate with chaos gods like Loki and Seth. They usually seek to subvert the status quo of the world, bringing chaos and disorder and destabilizing society and the prevailing authorities. Some may seek good and innovation, while others may dedicate themselves to destruction.

Determining the List of Spells for Clerics of Chaos:
d6 | Spell List
1 | Bard
2 | Cleric
3 | Druid
4 | Sorcerer
5 | Warlock
6 | Wizard

When you prepare spells from spell lists other than the cleric spell list, they become considered cleric spells for you. You retain access to all spells from your domain, but not other cleric spells. All other cleric spellcasting rules apply normally. Even if you acquire a spell list whose normal casters do not know all spells on the list to prepare them, you will still use the cleric rules, able to prepare any spell on the list as if it were a known spell for you.
	As a cleric of chaos, it&#39;s important to prepare a spell list for each possible option above in advance. This will ensure that you&#39;re ready to play and can easily switch your spell list as needed, without making other players wait. Remember to be courteous and considerate to your fellow players, even as you embody the chaos of your deity.

To rise to this challenge, they must embody exceptional mental and moral fortitude—true valor. Considering the paramount role that courage plays in their faith, it is little wonder that numerous deities claim dominion over this domain.
	One of such deities, The Glorious One has many clerics dedicated to the Courage domain, inspiring their followers to persevere through formidable circumstances and combat malevolence in pursuit of a better world. The Glorious One&#39;s standard, soaring high during conflicts, emboldens others to champion the cause of righteousness and remain steadfast in the face of trepidation. Tamera, the goddess of the sun and life, also boasts some disciples who uphold the tenet of courage, for they believe in kindling hope within the disheartened. Her adherents are celebrated for their unwavering dedication to aiding the destitute and uplifting the spirits of the populace. The dwarves of Tanares hold another assemblage of intrepid clerics with utmost esteem. These clerics of Dorsi are distinguished by their dauntlessness, resoluteness, and rousing battle cries. In times of strife, they spearhead the vanguard, bolstering their comrades to achieve greatness and instilling terror within their adversaries.
	These valiant clerics embody the essence of warriors, brandishing their weapons with expertise and igniting courage in those who surround them. As emissaries of their divine patrons, they epitomize bravery, guiding the common folk along the path of righteousness and honor.
	Be it a soldier on the battlefield or an adventurer delving into the uncharted, these intrepid champions of courage are able to embolden the resolute and face any challenge head on. Steered by their unyielding spirit and celestial mandate, they will never yield, advancing toward triumph with valor in their hearts.

	• As a bonus action, you can spend a Courage Point to summon your inner strength and smite your foes. Until the start of your next turn, your first successful melee attack deals +1d10 damage of the same type as your weapon. This damage increases to +2d10 at 6th level, +3d10 at 12th level, and +4d10 at 18th level.

	• As an action, you can spend a Courage Point to shout a powerful war cry that strengthens your party&#39;s resolve. You and all allies within 30 feet of you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your cleric level for 1 minute, and can roll a saving throw to remove any effect causing the frightened condition.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can&#39;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
	The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
	To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn&#39;t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.
	Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can&#39;t follow your command, the spell ends.

Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

Halt: The target doesn&#39;t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

Prone:
	• A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

Atonement: You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment.

Bless Water: You touch one vial of water and cause it to become Holy Water (flask).

Coming of Age: You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

Dedication: You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god&#39;s service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

Funeral Rite: You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can&#39;t become undead by any means short of a wish spell.

Wedding: You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.

	You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver.

2 | Fairness. I never target people who can&#39;t afford to lose a few coins. (Lawful)
3 | Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. (Good)

5 | I can&#39;t resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.

Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.

The perfect tool for anyone who wants to engage in trickery, a disguise kit enables its owner to adopt a false identity.

Components: A disguise kit includes cosmetics, hair dye, small props, and a few pieces of clothing.

Deception: In certain cases, a disguise can improve your ability to weave convincing lies.

Intimidation: The right disguise can make you look more fearsome, whether you want to scare someone away by posing as a plague victim or intimidate a gang of thugs by taking the appearance of a bully.

Performance: A cunning disguise can enhance an audience&#39;s enjoyment of a performance, provided the disguise is properly designed to evoke the desired reaction.

Persuasion: Folk tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts to persuade others are often more effective.

Create Disguise: As part of a long rest, you can create a disguise. It takes you 1 minute to don such a disguise once you have created it. You can carry only one such disguise on you at a time without drawing undue attention, unless you have a bag of holding or a similar method to keep them hidden. Each disguise weighs 1 pound.

At other times, it takes 10 minutes to craft a disguise that involves moderate changes to your appearance, and 30 minutes for one that requires more extensive changes.

Disguise Kit:

Cover injuries or distinguishing marks | 10
Spot a disguise being used by someone else | 15

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&#39;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#39;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
