They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&#38;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.
	The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.

They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.
	Elves&#39; coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>A Timeless Perspective</name><text>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
	Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Hidden Woodland Realms</name><text>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
	Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Exploration and Adventure</name><text>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Elf Names</name><text>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.
	On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf&#39;s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Alignment</name><text>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos.

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &#34;trance.&#34;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours.

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
	If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&#39;s voice, a lion&#39;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
	If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&#39;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
	If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a rogue.

	• Dexterity 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class&#39;s starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a rogue.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: none
	• Tools: thieves&#39; tools
	• Skills: Choose 1 from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand and Stealth

Source:	Player&#39;s Handbook (2014) p. 163</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Multiclass Features</name><text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don&#39;t, however, receive the class&#39;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you&#39;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn&#39;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don&#39;t add together. You can&#39;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter&#39;s version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock&#39;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn&#39;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can&#39;t gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don&#39;t have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don&#39;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you&#39;re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + Intelligence modifier + Proficiency Bonus

	Spell attack modifier = Intelligence modifier + Proficiency Bonus

They find easy employment as members of thieves&#39; guilds, though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.

	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since you gain your spells by divine communion or tapping intuitively into ancient mysteries. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Armed with coated blades and explosive vials of both chemical and alchemical mixtures, they are prepared for any situation. No matter how much wealth a noble accrues, or how big and strong a monster grows, they are nothing compared to the merciless touch of nature and you are its vessel.
	These debilitating, mind-numbing effects are produced by secret recipes, which are often only bequeathed from parent to child, or mentor to mentee. This oral tradition usually goes back to a particularly creative, and conveniently amoral alchemist, a back-alley apothecary, a trained physician, or even a disgruntled gardener.
	Whichever the case might be, you know your way around both a dagger and a cauldron. In the hands of a witchblade like you, a couple droplets can change the course of history.

You know three recipes from the Minor Compound Recipes list below. On your adventures, you might find other recipes from the Minor Compound list. You can learn a recipe found in this way by spending 8 hours experimenting with it.
	Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can brew two vials of minor compounds of your choice from the recipes you know. The compounds remain potent until the end of your next short or long rest.
	You can prepare one additional minor compound vial, and learn one additional minor compound recipe when you reach 9th, 13th, and 17th level in this class.
	You can administer your compounds in three ways:

	• Whenever you would use your Sneak Attack, you can choose to instead subject the target to the effects of one of your prepared compounds. This does not consume the vial&#39;s contents. If the compound has a duration, it lasts until the end of your next turn.

	• As an action, you can throw one of your vials at a surface you can see within 30 feet of you. The vial is destroyed, and it spreads a cloud of colorful gas which dissipates almost immediately. Any creature within 10 feet of the point of impact is subjected to the compound. If the compound has a duration, it lasts for 1 minute, and the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• As a bonus action, you pour the compound into up to 5 gallons of liquid or 5 pounds of food. Any creature which consumes the tainted item is subjected to the compound after 10 minutes. The vial is emptied and can&#39;t be used anymore. If the compound has a duration, it lasts for one hour.

When subjected to a compound, a creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or else suffer its effects. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

Croup. On a failed save, the creature becomes unable to speak, use breath weapons if it has any, or perform the verbal components of spells for the duration.

Feebleness. On a failed save, for the duration, the creature falls prone and can&#39;t stand up, drops any item it is holding, and lets go of any creature it is grappling.

Frenzy. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Sneak Attack dice for the duration. On a failed save, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion.

Haplessness. On a failed save, for the duration, whenever the creature makes an attack roll or ability check, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

Holy Water. On a failed save, the creature takes an amount of radiant damage equal to a roll of your Sneak Attack dice. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Either way, if the creature is reduced to 0 hit points before the duration ends, it is immediately stabilized.

Noxious Needle. On a failed save, the creature takes an amount of necrotic damage equal to a roll of your Sneak Attack dice and can&#39;t regain hit points for the duration. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

Often found alongside druids, rangers, and other protectors of the wild, Wayfinders traverse the land to preserve the balance between nature and civilization.
	On Ravnica, those who follow this archetype often join the Selesnya Conclave, granting them access to the power of the Worldsoul—a vast collected consciousness of wisdom and experience. In the Forgotten Realms, you might obtain your magic from a deity of nature, such as Melora or Mielikki. On other worlds, your ability to cast spells might come from a connection with a great nature spirit.
	Perhaps more than any other rogue, you understand the importance of community and working as one. You are skilled at leading the way and using the terrain to your group&#39;s advantage. This is true whether you are guiding allies through an overgrown forest, rubble of a destroyed city block, or people on a crowded street.

See chapter 10 of the Basic Rules or the Player&#39;s Handbook for the general rules of spell- casting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Wayfinder Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of them, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell entangle and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast entangle using either slot.

Preparing Spells:
You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your rogue level divided by 3, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:
at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

If you are planting the trinket on an unwilling creature, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the Wisdom (Perception) of the creature. If you win, you successfully plant the trinket. The trinket deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit when triggered, can benefit from your Sneak Attack, can be coated with a potion, poison, etc. and can either target a creature it is planted on or a target within 10 feet of it. The trinket uses your attack bonuses, and if the trinket is planted on the target of the attack, it has advantage on the attack roll. Once the trinket is triggered, it must be reset before it can be triggered again. You can have a number of trinkets waiting to be triggered equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Trinkets:
Puzzler rogues use trinkets to mark their enemies, initiate poisons, and even make mechanical weapons. For inventory purposes, a trinket can be one of the trinkets noted at the end of chapter 5 in the Player&#39;s Handbook, or any piece of equipment costing at least 1 gp-such as ball bearings or caltrops. The DM may rule that a trinket must contain certain materials in order to produce specific results; metal for shrapnel bombs, for example.

In ages past, some allowed this inquisitiveness to guide them toward a rogue&#39;s life devoted to bridging that gap by breaking into any and all structures, dungeons, or walled-off regions that prevented them from satisfying their curiosity.
	So successful were these first catfolk burglars that other rogues soon began emulating their techniques. Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls. In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find;
after all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there? Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or warded by magic.
	Some cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums. You&#39;ll likely end up someplace you&#39;re not supposed to be, but those are the places most worth visiting!

Alchemical Bomb. As an action, you can mix together volatile chemicals into an explosive compound and throw it at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Alchemical bombs lose their potency and become inert 1 minute after they are created.
	If a construct fails the saving throw or if you throw the bomb at a structure or an object that isn&#39;t being worn or carried, your bomb also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.

Jury Rig Fortification. You are adept at creating fortifications with whatever materials are at hand.

With 1 minute of work, you can create one of the following. Your ability to use this option might be limited by the available building materials or if the ground is too hard to work, at the GM&#39;s discretion.
	• Create a low wall that is large enough to provide half cover to a Medium creature.

	• Your Divine Symbol functions as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

	• As a bonus action, you can turn the symbol into thieves&#39; tools, which you can use to pick locks, disarm traps, or any other activities that would normally require such tools. While your Divine Symbol is functioning in this way, it loses all other properties listed here. You can change it from thieves&#39; tools back to its symbol form as a bonus action.

	• The symbol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. When you extinguish the symbol&#39;s light, you can also snuff out one candle, torch, or other nonmagical light source within 10 feet of you.

	• When you create this symbol, and as an action on each of your turns while the symbol is active, you can force the symbol to shoot divine energy at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you reach certain levels in this class, the symbol&#39;s damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips: shillelagh and two other cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at loth level.

Spell Slots:
The Underfoot Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend one of these slots at the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell longstrider and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast longstrider using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination and transmutation spells on the druid spell list. The Spells Known column of the Underfoot Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a divination or transmutation spell of your choice and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.
	When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the druid spells you know and replace it with another spell from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you&#39;re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. Your magic draws upon your connection with the natural world. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Trained in the lethal arts of combat, weaponry, and stealth, they wielded their surroundings as a deadly weapon, shrouding their identities in mystery to protect their communities from retaliation. Through relentless training and the refinement of their skills, these rebels transformed into merciless assassins, combat specialists, and the undisputed masters of disguise, all united under the banner of secretive and powerful clans.
	Each Ninja clan is fiercely dedicated to its own unique purpose, guided by the timeless principles of their ancestral leaders. They abide by a strict code of honor, shrouded in mystery, that is as unyielding as their commitment to their cause. While their methods may appear dishonorable to outsiders, the loyalty of each Ninja to their clan is unbreakable, even if it means committing acts that are ethically questionable. This unwavering commitment to the goals set forth by their ancestral leaders forms the very foundation of the Ninja&#39;s code of honor.
	In addition to their physical prowess, Ninjas wield a mystical power known as Ki, imbuing their techniques with otherworldly, ethereal effects. While their methods differ from those of monks, the similarities between the two are undeniable and respected by both groups. With their mastery of combat, stealth, and the mystical arts, the Ninjas are a force to be reckoned with, always keeping their true goals hidden from the prying eyes of the outside world.

In Tanares:
	The Kageryoshi, a clan of legendary and respected ninjas in the bustling city of Kagemori, were created by Kagekusari, a powerful Tameranium Dragon and the Fumetsu Tenshikin&#39;s son. To counteract the cunning criminal organizations attempting to corrupt Yama from within, led by the formidable Bauronite Avatar Dragon Yokensha, the Kageryoshi were forged to match their wits and strategy.
	The rigorous training of the Kageryoshi begins at a young age, culminating in a final test that involves facing Kagekusari himself in both humanoid and dragon form. Under Kagekusari&#39;s guidance, the Kageryoshi mastered their mystical Ki powers, becoming experts in stealth, deception, and manipulation. Their code of honor was unbreakable loyalty to Fumetsu Tenshikin, and they were trained to do whatever was necessary to ensure Yama&#39;s success and protect their leader, even if it meant breaking the rules or engaging in unethical acts.
	Fumetsu Tenshikin saw the unmatched skills of the Kageryoshi and appointed them as his elite agents, tasked with the most dangerous and covert missions, especially those in delicate international operations where Yama&#39;s other agents could not operate with discretion.
	The Kageryoshi&#39;s reputation for ruthlessness is rivaled only by their loyalty to their clan and code of honor. Those who have defected to opposing factions and use their skills for personal gain are seen as traitors and shunned by the Kageryoshi. Kagekusari, as their mentor and guide, embodies their loyalty and power, a testament to the unbreakable bond between the Kageryoshi and Fumetsu Tenshikin.

The bombs that you can create are detailed in the &#34;Bomb Designs&#34; section below.
	You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts up to 2 explosive devices of your choice, selected from the list of &#34;Bomb Designs&#34; below. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you. After you use this feature, you can&#39;t use it again until you complete a long rest.

Using an Explosive Device. Unless the bomb design&#39;s description says otherwise, you must use your action to use an explosive device. Once you use the device, it is destroyed and cannot be used again. If another creature attempts to use one of your explosive devices, it must make a DC 10 Intelligence check using demolitionists tools. On a success, the creature can use the device.

	You must use an action to throw this explosive device as a ranged weapon attack at a target you can see within 30 feet of you before the end of your next turn; otherwise, the quick bomb loses its potency and the materials spent creating it are wasted. On a hit, the bomb deals 2d6 fire damage. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: 3d6 at 7th level, 4d6 at 13th level, and 5d6 at 19th level.

	The bomb designs are presented here in alphabetical order. If a bomb design requires a level, you must be that level in this class to learn the design.

Boom Bucket. You can throw this explosive device at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. On impact, it explodes in a 5-foot sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your bomb craft DC, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren&#39;t being worn or carried. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: 4d6 at 7th level, 5d6 at 13th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.

Concussion Grenade. You can throw this explosive device at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. On impact, it explodes in a 5-foot radius sphere centered on that point.
	Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your bomb craft DC, taking 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the point of explosion. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the explosive device&#39;s effect. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: 3d8 at 7th level, 4d8 at 13th level, and 5d8 at 19th level.

Door Knocker (7th Level Required). You can place this explosive device on a locking mechanism, hinge, or other functional parts of a closed door, window, gate, or chest andlight the fuse. At the end of your current turn, the explosive device explodes.
	After the explosion, the object is easier to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it decreases by 10. If this reduces the DC to 0 or less, the object automatically opens. If this explosive device is accidentally triggered by someone other than you trying to use it, it deals 4d6 piercing damage to the creature holding it.

Dragon Fist (7th Level Required). You can throw this explosive device as a ranged weapon attack at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the bomb deals 6d6 fire damage. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: 8d6 at 13th level and 10d6 at 19th level.

Fire Cyclone (19th Level Required). You throw this explosive device at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of your current turn, the device erupts into a 20-foot radius sphere of whirling air and fire centered on that point. The sphere remains for 1 minute. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one.

Fireworks (7th Level Required). You throw this explosive device at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. The device erupts into brilliant fireworks at the end of your current turn. Each creature within 10 feet of the fireworks must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your bomb craft DC or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

Flame Thrower (7th Level Required). The flame thrower is an apparatus that requires both hands to use. As a bonus action, you can activate the flame thrower. Once activated, the flame thrower spews a 15-foot cone of fire from the end of the flame thrower&#39;s nozzle. At the start of each of your turns, you decide which way the cone faces. Each creature that you hit with the fire or starts its turn in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: 4d6 at 13th level and 5d6 at 19th level.
	An activated flame thrower stops spewing flame after 1 minute or if you use your bonus action to deactivate it. Once it is deactivated, the flame thrower is destroyed even if you did not use it for its entire duration.
	While the flame thrower is activated, your speed becomes 0 and you can&#39;t use actions or reactions, and you can only use your bonus action to deactivate the flame thrower.
	If you are hit by a critical hit while the flame throw is activated, it explodes. When it explodes, you must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Glue Bomb (7th Level Required). You can throw this explosive device at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. On impact, a mess of sticky glue fills a 20-foot cube from that point. The glue is difficult terrain. Each creature caught in the glue explosion must make a Dexterity saving throw against your bomb craft DC. On a failed save, the creature takes one level of exhaustion and is restrained as long as it remains in the glue or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the glue can use its action to make a Strength check against your bomb craft DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

Room Clearer (13th Level Required). You can throw this explosive device at a point that you can see within 30 feet of you. The device explodes in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point at the end of your current turn. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&#39;t being worn or carried. When you reach 19th level in this class, the damage increases to 9d6.

Smoke Bomb. You can throw this explosive device at a point that you can see within 30 feet of you. On impact, it emits a 20-foot radius sphere of smoke centered on that point. The sphere spreads around corners and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When you reach certain levels in this class, the radius of the sphere increases: 40 feet at 7th level, 60 feet at 13th level, and 80 feet at 19th level.

Stink Bomb (13th Level Required).You can throw this explosive device at a point that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of your current turn, the explosive device emits a 20-foot radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on that point. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for 1 minute. Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw versus your bomb craft DC. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don&#39;t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Alternate Rule: Playing Cards
When you play a Gambler rogue, you can choose to use a standard deck of 52 poker cards (and jokers) to determine the bonus effect for your Pick a Card feature. When you hit with a playing card attack, draw a random card from your deck. The card&#39;s suit determines the bonus effect for Pick a Card: Clubs (1), Diamonds (2), Hearts (3), Spades (4). If you draw a joker, you pick which effect happens.

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Justicar Spell List at the end of this Archetype, and you learn an additional Justicar cantrip when you reach 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Justicar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the wrathful smite spell and have both a 1st and a 2nd-level spell slot, you can cast wrathful smite using either spell slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level justicar spells. The Spells Known column of the Justicar Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher, of a level for which you have spell slots.
	When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Justicar Spell List. The spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for justicar spells, as your power is fueled by belief. You use Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a justicar spell.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6.

Psionic Talent Options:
You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:

Psi-Bolstered Knack. When your non-psionic training fails you, you can tap into your psionic power to help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success.

Psychic Whispers. You can use your psychic abilities to establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, you give yourself and at least one other creature the ability to speak telepathically with each other. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to the number rolled. For 1 hour, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can&#39;t use this telepathy if it can&#39;t speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don&#39;t need to speak a common language to understand each other.

Changing the Die&#39;s Size:
If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it&#39;s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.
	Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.
	Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

Psi Replenishment:
As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can&#39;t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.

	How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or thieves&#39; guild dedicated to a god of death?

The first is the weapon&#39;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#39;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Perhaps the most common tools used by adventurers, thieves&#39; tools are designed for picking locks and foiling traps. Proficiency with the tools also grants you a general knowledge of traps and locks.

Components: Thieves&#39; tools include a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.

History: Your knowledge of traps grants you insight when answering questions about locations that are renowned for their traps.

Investigation and Perception: You gain additional insight when looking for traps, because you have learned a variety of common signs that betray their presence.

Set a Trap: Just as you can disable traps, you can also set them. As part of a short rest, you can create a trap using items you have on hand. The total of your check becomes the DC for someone else&#39;s attempt to discover or disable the trap. The trap deals damage appropriate to the materials used in crafting it (such as poison or a weapon) or damage equal to half the total of your check, whichever the DM deems appropriate.

The perfect tool for anyone who wants to engage in trickery, a disguise kit enables its owner to adopt a false identity.

Components: A disguise kit includes cosmetics, hair dye, small props, and a few pieces of clothing.

Deception: In certain cases, a disguise can improve your ability to weave convincing lies.

Intimidation: The right disguise can make you look more fearsome, whether you want to scare someone away by posing as a plague victim or intimidate a gang of thugs by taking the appearance of a bully.

Performance: A cunning disguise can enhance an audience&#39;s enjoyment of a performance, provided the disguise is properly designed to evoke the desired reaction.

Persuasion: Folk tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts to persuade others are often more effective.

Create Disguise: As part of a long rest, you can create a disguise. It takes you 1 minute to don such a disguise once you have created it. You can carry only one such disguise on you at a time without drawing undue attention, unless you have a bag of holding or a similar method to keep them hidden. Each disguise weighs 1 pound.

At other times, it takes 10 minutes to craft a disguise that involves moderate changes to your appearance, and 30 minutes for one that requires more extensive changes.
