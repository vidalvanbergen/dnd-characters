In that timeless, silvery realm, githyanki honed their psionic powers and built a great city called Tu&#39;narath. They have since spread throughout the multiverse, starting in outposts outside the Astral Plane, called creches, where time passes and their children can reach adulthood.
	A lanky people with skin tones of yellows, greens, and browns, githyanki complement their physical prowess with psionic might, instilled in them by mind flayers and cultivated over eons in the Astral Plane. Now all githyanki can use their psychic bond with that plane to access splinters of knowledge left behind by beings who travel, live, and die among the silver astral clouds.
	Githyanki who reside in the Astral Plane can live indefinitely.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least 1 of the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a fighter.

	• Strength 13, or
	• Dexterity 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class&#39;s starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a fighter.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

Source:	Player&#39;s Handbook (2014) p. 70</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Multiclass Features</name><text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don&#39;t, however, receive the class&#39;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you&#39;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn&#39;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don&#39;t add together. You can&#39;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter&#39;s version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock&#39;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn&#39;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can&#39;t gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don&#39;t have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don&#39;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

Maneuvers. You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
	You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

Saving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&#39;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic—abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter&#39;s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you&#39;re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + Intelligence modifier + Proficiency Bonus

	A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.
	A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight&#39;s actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.

Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.
	The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Cloud Rune. This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.
	In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack&#39;s effects regardless of the attack&#39;s range. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Fire Rune. This rune&#39;s magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
	In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Frost Rune. This rune&#39;s magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
	In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Stone Rune. This rune&#39;s magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
	In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher). This rune&#39;s magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.
	In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher). Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can&#39;t be surprised as long as you aren&#39;t incapacitated.
	In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you&#39;re incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage.

Creating Compounds. You learn three compounds of your choice, which are detailed under the &#34;Fighter (Living Crucible): Compounds&#34; spell list. You can create any number of these compounds you know by using alchemist&#39;s supplies and spending 10 minutes to create them. These compounds remain potent until the end of your next long rest, after which time they become inert and have no effect.
	You learn two additional compounds of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new compounds, you can also replace one compound you know with another one.

Consuming Compounds. As a bonus action you can consume a single compound using this feature. You can safely consume a number of compounds up to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). Each compound you consume after that causes you to gain a level of exhaustion. When you finish a long rest, you regain the ability to safely consume compounds. You can benefit from multiple compounds at the same time, but taking the same compound more than once provides no additional effects.
	The benefits associated with each compound apply only to you. Any other creature that consumes one of your compounds must succeed on a Constitution saving throw DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or become poisoned for 1 minute.

Dragoons are elite combatants, selected from the ranks of standard cavalry soldiers for their prowess in battle and exceptional mounted dexterity. Their specialized training focuses as much on scouting and survival as it does advanced unit tactics, creating warriors who are just as effective on their own as with the main body of an army.
	A dragoon&#39;s effectiveness comes from seamlessly weaving a variety of weapons into mounted tactics in order to control the ebb and flow of the battlefield and halt any retreat.
	While the refined techniques of the dragoon are typically employed by the regimented armies of humans, elves, and dwarves, there are tribes of barbarians and even wolf-mounted goblins that have cultivated a form of this style with their favored blade or axe.

These weapons share the length and weight of a longsword, with the curvature of a scimitar, and are designed to be light enough for use in one hand, but not for two-weapon combat. A cavalry weapon can be any one-handed weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage and doesn&#39;t have the light or finesse properties. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your cavalry weapon deals 1d8 damage, regardless of its damage die.
	In trained hands, the saber is a graceful and deadly weapon but even a seasoned fighter might find them clumsy when dealing with its balance. Certain cultures dragoons might favor raiding axes or falchions but it is common practice for units to be familiar with the weapons and tactics of their counterparts.

In exchange for heavy armor&#39;s protection, mounted or not, you gain maneuverability and precision. When wearing medium armor, you add double your Strength modifier to damage rolls with your cavalry weapon and your speed increases by 5 feet. While you&#39;re mounted, the speed of your mount also increases by 5 feet.
	When unarmored, or wearing light armor, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any attack rolls you make with your cavalry weapon, in addition to the benefits of wearing medium armor, and your speed increases by an additional 5 feet, to a total of 10 feet. While you&#39;re mounted, the speed of your mount also increases in this way.
	Additionally, when you use the Attack action to attack with a cavalry weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded one-handed ranged weapon you are holding. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn&#39;t impose disadvantage on this ranged attack.

Their effects are based on how you invoke them, generating defensive properties to thwart your foes&#39; advance or deal decisive blows.

Ritual Crafting. Each runic combination must be inscribed and empowered into your equipment over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest. Each piece of equipment must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which, you infuse a part of your being into the runes, causing them to glow slightly with your own spiritual essence.
	The rune&#39;s power fades if it moves more than 100 feet away from you and can&#39;t be used by anyone other than you.

Runic Augmentations. You learn three runic augmentations of your choice from the &#34;Fighter (Runegard (HB)): Runic Augmentations&#34; spell list. Each augmentation is specific to its master rune; for instance, if you learn the Sokn augmentation of the Ild master rune, you don&#39;t gain the ability to use the Sokn augmentation with other master runes unless you also learn that specific combination.
	Once you activate one of your runic augmentations, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
	You learn two additional augmentations at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn new augmentations, you can choose to replace one you already know with a different one.

Augmentation Activation. During your turn, you can activate a single runic augmentation by focusing on the rune&#39;s power. You can activate one of these augmentations on your turn using your bonus action to empower your attacks (Sokn), your reaction to entrench your defenses (Vard) or skillfully enhance another ability (Hagr) with your action.
	Activating a rune requires concentration, which lasts a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 3). While you concentrate on a rune, you can cast spells but you can&#39;t concentrate on a rune and a spell at the same time. You gain the ability to concentrate on two runes at once at 10th level.

Saving Throws. Some of your runic augmentations require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Runic save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

They took these experiments further, ordering the Obitus Scholare to harness that power. The desperate fight against the scourge demanded urgent results; no act was too sacred nor debauched. And so, the accursed Luyarnha gave birth to living nightmares, monsters of its own creation.

	Living Nightmare save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

You choose the weapon&#39;s form each time you make an attack roll:

Stinger. One of your limbs grows into a razor-sharp blade. It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. When you take the Attack action to attack with it on your turn, you can use a bonus action to turn another limb into a Stinger and strike with it, making a single additional attack.

Hammer Arm. Your arms turn into a black-tinted bone club. On a hit, it deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage and you can choose to push the target 5 feet away.

Tendinous Lash. One of your limbs replaces its bones with tough coiled ligaments, allowing it to stretch a disturbing distance without breaking. It deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit and has a reach of 15 feet. In addition, the first time on a turn you deal damage with your lash, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or be knocked prone as the limb sweeps their feet.

This chilling bond may arise from arcane rituals, a miraculous resurrection, or an encounter with the afterlife that attunes the warrior to death&#39;s dark might.
	Misunderstood and dreaded, Death Knights are often perceived as cold, sinister beings, seemingly indifferent to death itself. However, they merely regard it as an intrinsic aspect of life&#39;s cycle, a force they harness with great efficacy.
	In kemet society, Death Knights have achieved fame for their insatiable thirst for battle and intimate connection with death, leading to the refinement of necromantic augmentations over countless generations. They also emerge in other death-revering cultures such as the Kepesh, as well as amongst malevolent cults, corrupted Dorsianist dwarves, and Shadow Wing devotees. Remarkably, virtuous Death Knights can be found among a few tragic heroes and the Republic-aligned winter elves who renounced Gullog.
	Although Death Knights need not be inherently malevolent, it requires a stoic or extraordinary individual to attune their existence to death&#39;s dominion. Regardless, the mere presence of a Death Knight is a formidable threat, for their unyielding pursuit of victory is undeterred by the specter of death.

In Other Settings:
The Death Knight, a wielder of death&#39;s dark might, can be found in any world where the shadow of death looms over warriors. An inseparable part of life&#39;s cycle, death holds a captivating allure for those who stand in its presence, be it by their own choice or by the fates.
	This fearsome subclass can take on many forms: a fallen champion, a harbinger of evil, a warrior risen from the dead seeking retribution, or even a hero shrouded in mystery, harnessing a power feared by many for the greater good. Yet the Death Knight is not limited to just these archetypes. They can also be malevolent tyrants, leading an army of undead to conquer the lands, anti-heroes, wielding death&#39;s power in their quest for redemption, or even servants of death gods, serving as their deity&#39;s chosen instrument of destruction.
	Regardless of their role, the Death Knight is a force to be reckoned with, for death holds no sway over their relentless pursuit of victory. With their inextricable connection to death and mastery of its power, the mere mention of a Death Knight&#39;s name is enough to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies, making them a formidable presence on any battlefield.

Feared frontline warriors bearing lances and unique, streamlined armor, Celestial Lancers are famous for their Meteor Jump, a supernatural technique taught only to the rare few. The lancers trace their origins back to an order of dragon hunters who learned to leap above diving dragons and pin their wings with a swift, downward lance strike. This technique, combined with a suite of mystical powers drawn from the yawning sky, makes the lancers decisive warriors in the arena of vertical combat.

Mage Hand Magi have mastered this cantrip through practice and discipline, elaborating a trick pioneered by warmages into a deadly fighting style of twin hovering blades.

Armor. As a reaction when the wearer is hit by an attack, it can force the attacker to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is blinded for 1 minute. It can repeat the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.
	Once the wearer uses this reaction, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use the reaction again.

Weapon. When the wielder hit a creature with this weapon, it can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded for 1 minute. It can repeat its save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.

Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a long or short rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

Using Superiority Dice. You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

	• When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.

	• When you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.

	• When you make an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this feature only before you learn if the save succeeded or failed.

	• When you make a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect a hidden creature or object, or a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine if someone is lying to you, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll.

This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6.

Psionic Talent Options:
You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:

Protective Field. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to roll your Psionic Talent die and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.

Psi-Powered Leap. When you make a high or long jump, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and extend the distance of the jump, up to a number of feet equal to twice the number rolled plus twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 extra foot). This extra distance costs you only 1 foot of movement.

Telekinetic Strike. You can propel your attacks with telekinetic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you deal damage to a target within 30 feet of you with a weapon attack, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and also deal force damage to the target equal to the number rolled.

Changing the Die&#39;s Size:
If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it&#39;s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.
	Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.
	Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

Psi Replenishment:
As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can&#39;t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.

At 7th level, you learn two gambits. You learn an additional gambit at 10th and 18th level.

You use a gambit as an action. You can use your gambits a number of times based on your fighter level.

Each time you complete a long rest, you regain all expended uses of your gambits and can swap one of your gambits for a different one.

Warlord (Livestream): Saving Throws
A gambit sometimes requires a saving throw. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Warlord (Livestream): Gambits
The gambits are presented in alphabetical order.

Warlord (Livestream): Aggressive Advance
You and your allies howl in rage and glower at your foes, making a display that sends fear into their hearts.

Hostile creatures within 60 feet of you that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened of your tactical focus. A creature frightened by this effect can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action. [In future, may be changed to require you or an ally to be present within the focus.]

Warlord (Livestream): Cut Them Down!
You direct your allies to strike with perfect timing. Landing blows just as your enemies are of balance to send them tumbling to the ground.

Until the end of your next turn, hostile creatures in your tactical focus that you can see must make Strength saves each time they are hit by an attack. On a failed save, they are knocked prone. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

Warlord (Livestream): Luring Gambit
You entangle your weapon with a chosen foe, luring it to duel you as your allies close in for the kill.

As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action. If you hit a creature with a weapon attack during your turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your allies are invisible to it until the end of your next turn.

Warlord (Livestream): Pile On
You direct your allies&#39; attacks against a target, each blow building on the next to build a devastating result. Select a creature in your tactical focus that you can see. At the start of your next turn, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw if you or an ally has hit it with an attack since you used this ability. It suffers disadvantage on the saving throw if it has been hit by three or more attacks [in future, this may be changed to &#34;hit by three or more creatures&#34;]. On a failed saving throw, the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn.

As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

Warlord (Livestream): Pincer Movement
With precise timing, you order your allies to charge into the enemy, dealing body checks that leave your foes entangled and helpless.

Up to two allies that can see or hear you can use their reactions to move up to their speed. Any creature adjacent to both of your allies or to you and one of the chosen allies at the end of their movement must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the end of your next turn. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

Warlord (Livestream): Vexing Maneuvers
With precise movements, you and your allies dash around the foes to leave them confused and unable to pick out their most dangerous targets.

Each enemy in your tactical focus that you can see must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot leave your tactical focus using its move until the end of your next turn. As part of this gambit you may take the attack action.

You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.
	When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Or it might have been a noble&#39;s or merchant&#39;s private army, or a mercenary company.

Soldier Role:
d8 | Role
1 | Officer
2 | Scout
3 | Infantry
4 | Cavalry
5 | Healer
6 | Quartermaster
7 | Standard bearer
8 | Support staff (cook, blacksmith, or the like)</text></feat><feat><name>Feature: Military Rank</name><text>You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.</text></feat><feat><name>Suggested Characteristics</name><text>The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I&#39;m always polite and respectful.
2 | I&#39;m haunted by memories of war. I can&#39;t get the images of violence out of my mind.
3 | I&#39;ve lost too many friends, and I&#39;m slow to make new ones.
4 | I&#39;m full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my military experience relevant to almost every combat situation.
5 | I can stare down a hell hound without flinching.
6 | I enjoy being strong and like breaking things.
7 | I have a crude sense of humor.
8 | I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others. (Good)
2 | Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful)
3 | Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. (Chaotic)
4 | Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins. (Evil)
5 | Live and Let Live. Ideals aren&#39;t worth killing over or going to war for. (Neutral)
6 | Nation. My city, nation, or people are all that matter. (Any)

d6 | Bond
1 | I would still lay down my life for the people I served with.
2 | Someone saved my life on the battlefield. To this day, I will never leave a friend behind.
3 | My honor is my life.
4 | I&#39;ll never forget the crushing defeat my company suffered or the enemies who dealt it.
5 | Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for.
6 | I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.

d6 | Flaw
1 | The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear.
2 | I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior.
3 | I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost many lives, and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret.
4 | My hatred of my enemies is blind and unreasoning.
5 | I obey the law, even if the law causes misery.
6 | I&#39;d rather eat my armor than admit when I&#39;m wrong.</text></feat><proficiency>107</proficiency><proficiency>117</proficiency></background>

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.
