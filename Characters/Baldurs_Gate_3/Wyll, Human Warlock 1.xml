Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that&#39;s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.

There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Variety in All Things</name><text>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human&#39;s memory. They live fully in the present-making them well suited to the adventuring life-but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Lasting Institutions</name><text>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death&#39;s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.
	Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Exemplars of Ambition</name><text>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Human Names and Ethnicities</name><text>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region&#39;s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.
	The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east-and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.
	In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerun. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.

Calishite:
Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes.

Mulan:
Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of the Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and amber-skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in the lands where the Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan shave off all their hair.

Mulan Names: (Male) Aoth, Bareris, Ehput-Ki, Kethoth, Mumed, Ramas, So-Kehur, Thazar-De, Urhur; (female) Arizima, Chathi, Nephis, Nulara, Murithi, Sefris, Thola, Umara, Zolis; (surnames) Ankhalab, Anskuld, Fezim, Hahpet, Nathandem, Sepret, Uuthrakt

Widespread along the entire Sword Coast at the western edge of Faerun, Tethyrians are of medium build and height, with dusky skin that tends to grow fairer the farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians primarily use Chondathan names.

Turami:
Native to the southern shore of the Inner Sea, the Turami people are generally tall and muscular, with dark mahogany skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes.

Turami Names: (Male) Anton, Diero, Marcon, Pieron, Rimardo, Romero, Salazar, Umbero; (female) Balama, Dona, Faila, Jalana, Luisa, Marta, Quara, Selise, Vonda; (surnames) Agosto, Astorio, Calabra, Domine, Falone, Marivaldi, Pisacar, Ramondo</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Age</name><text>Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Alignment</name><text>Humans tend toward no particular alignment.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.

Cantrips:
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

Spell Slots:
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&#39;s shown in the table&#39;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus

	Spell attack modifier = Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a warlock.

	• Charisma 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class&#39;s starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a warlock.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: simple weapons
	• Tools: none

Source:	Player&#39;s Handbook (2014) p. 105</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Multiclass Features</name><text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don&#39;t, however, receive the class&#39;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you&#39;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn&#39;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don&#39;t add together. You can&#39;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter&#39;s version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock&#39;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn&#39;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can&#39;t gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don&#39;t have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don&#39;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

	Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn&#39;t make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.

	Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days.

The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.
	Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.

The vessel is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. You decide what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Genie&#39;s Vessel table.

Genie&#39;s Vessel:
d6 | Vessel
1 | Oil lamp
2 | Urn
3 | Ring with a compartment
4 | Stoppered bottle
5 | Hollow statuette
6 | Ornate lantern

While you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:

Bottled Respite. As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel&#39;s former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can&#39;t enter again until you finish a long rest.

Genie&#39;s Wrath. Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

The vessel&#39;s AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.
	If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient undead know firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death.

Opportunity Attacks &#38; Parasitic Weapon:

The type of gen is dependent upon your patron&#39;s genie type as defined on the Noble Genie Patron table. Your gen vizier isn&#39;t required to obey your commands, although it usually tries to the best of its ability, and doesn&#39;t participate in combat.
	You gain the following benefit from your gen vizier.

Spell Fetching. You can send your gen to find and retrieve the knowledge of an additional spell you don&#39;t know. The spell can be from any class spell list but must be of a level you can cast with one of your warlock spell slots. As a bonus action, you can request a spell for your gen to retrieve and it returns in a number of rounds equal to 1d12 minus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
	When the gen returns, it immediately imparts the spell knowledge to you at the beginning of your turn, which you can then cast normally by expending a warlock spell slot. If you don&#39;t cast the spell within two rounds of receiving it, the spell knowledge disappears, and you can&#39;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
	You can use this feature twice between long rests at 6th level and three times between long rests at 14th level.

	Whenever a humanoid within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points and dies, you can use your reaction to summon a raven spirit in the square the creature occupied prior to its death. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you. A raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.
	If you have a raven spirit previously summoned, and you summon another, the ravens flock together, and attempt to occupy the same space at all times. If you have 5 or more ravens flocking together in this way, you may permanently band the flock together as a swarm. The flock of ravens assumes the form and game statistics of a a swarm of ravens. The maximum number of raven spirits you can maintain at once is equal to half your warlock level.
	In combat, the ravens and swarms move and act as a group and take their turn immediately after your turn. You control how the group acts.
	If a raven is slain by a creature, or a swarm is damaged by a creature you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the creature until the end of your next turn.
	At the end of a short or long rest, you can call all the ravens back to you—no matter where they are—and they reappear within 5 feet of you. At the end of a long rest, you may spend one spell slot to summon a number of ravens up to half your warlock level, but not exceeding the maximum.

	Once per turn when you cast a spell, you can trigger the curse if that spell deals cold or lightning damage to the cursed target or forces it to move. Doing so subjects the target to the appropriate additional effect below, and then the curse ends if the spell that triggered the curse isn&#39;t a cantrip (you choose the effect to use if more than one effect applies):

Cold Damage. If the affected target takes cold damage from your spell, the target&#39;s speed is also reduced by 15 feet until the end of your next turn. If the spell already reduces the target&#39;s speed, use whichever reduction is greater.

Lightning Damage. If the affected target takes lightning damage from your spell, the target cannot take reactions until the start of your next turn.

Forced Movement. If the target is moved by your spell, increase the distance it is moved by 15 feet.

On a successful save the creature takes half damage and is not poisoned.
	In addition, when a creature touches you for the first time on a turn or starts its turn while touching or grappling you, it takes 1d6 acid damage. If you aren&#39;t incapacitated, you can prevent this damage when a creature touches you.
	Any nonmagical weapon or armor made of metal or wood that you touch starts corroding.

Boreal. Like a pine tree in the taiga, you can enter a state of hibernation. As an action, you can turn yourself and your equipment to solid wood. You are petrified in a special way. You have all the traits of the petrified condition, except you remain conscious of your surroundings, you can perceive through your senses as normal, and your weight remains the same.

Whether you sought these powers purposely, misunderstood an agreement you were making, or now serve as punishment for breaching a contract, your patron&#39;s powers allow you to impose law and order, sidestepping fate and luck instead for the blessing of definite results.
	Perhaps you forged a contract in the Halls of Concordance. If so, your patron may be a quarut, marut, or kolyarut of Mechanus. In the world of Ravnica, a high ranking member of the Azorius Senate might act as your patron, or your powers might come from the Guild Pact itself.
	Your contract may require you to assist in establishing order in various ways. You can choose a directive, allow your DM to choose one, or determine one randomly, using the Inevitable Directive table.

Inevitable Directive:
1d6 | Directive
1 | To hunt fugitives of the law and those who try to escape punishment.
2 | To write, deliver, or witness the signing of minor contracts.
3 | To apprehend those who break interplanar contracts.
4 | To enforce the laws of life and death, hunting those who would deny the grave or otherwise disrupt the flow of souls into the afterlife.
5 | To maintain the laws of space and time, investigating permanent portals between planes or temporal disruptions and disorder.
6 | To support the divine order and help stop those who seek to destroy or become gods.

Your Contract:
To an inevitable, the spirit of an agreement is nothing, and the letter of the law is everything. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your contract, how it might be enforced, what directive best suits your campaign, how closely you might be monitored, and what the consequences might be for breaking it. Breaking your contract, however, shouldn&#39;t mean an immediate end for your character. Instead, it should create interesting and meaningful complications.  For example, if you serve a marut hunting someone who broke an extraplanar contract, your patron may suddenly appear to drag you back to the Halls for judgement should you be discovered aiding your quarry or allowing it to escape justice. As punishment, you might temporarily lose access to one or more of your warlock class features, or be assigned a proctor to observe you more carefully, such as a modron for a familiar.

Very few are able to withstand such knowledge and power, and the few that do are often seen as mysterious and reclusive figures.
	Warlocks who strike a pact with the Void walk an eerie and dangerous path, focused on manipulating gravity and harnessing the immense power of black holes. Crushing their foes in condensed wells of gravity, whilst liberating themselves from the shackles that hold them, these warlocks carve their own destiny under the guidance of the cosmos.

This black hole has a domain of influence of 5 feet beyond its own radius. It lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). The black hole is considered difficult terrain for all creatures except for you.
	When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the ability ends, unsecured objects within the domain of influence of the miniature black hole are pulled toward the sphere&#39;s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.
	As part of creating the sphere, and on subsequent turns as a bonus action, you can choose a creature within the domain of influence of the black hole, increasing the pull of gravity around them. They must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled straight toward the sphere&#39;s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the black hole&#39;s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 1d6 magical bludgeoning damage and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.
	Once you use this feature, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a warlock spell slot to use it again.

This miniature black hole grows with you. When your pact magic increases in power, so does this feature:

	• At 3rd level in this class, when a creature enters the black hole&#39;s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is restrained for the duration. A restrained creature can attempt to free itself by using an action to make an Athletics check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the black hole and is moved to the nearest unoccupied space outside the black hole.

	• At 5th level in this class, the domain of influence of the sphere increases to 10 feet and is considered difficult terrain for all creatures except for you. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while inside the black hole is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

	• At 7th level in this class, the diameter of the black hole increases to 10 feet.

	• At 9th level in this class, the damage increases to 2d6 and the sphere&#39;s domain of influence to 20 feet. You can summon the black hole at any point that you can see, not just on the ground. If the sphere is in the air, creatures restrained by it hover inside the black hole.

Note: The black hole and its domain of influence are two different things. At 3rd level, only the black hole, meaning the 5-foot diameter sphere at the center of your ravenous void, can restrain creatures.

It desires you to act as its hand in your world, eradicating the dark beings hidden in the shadows.
	Different from other warlocks you train your body and mind to exhaustion to fight the creatures of darkness. You learn how to properly use all kinds of weapons to deliver your powerful magic abilities, channeling your powers through blades and bolts alike, becoming the terror of all dark beings.
	Moved by vengeance, a strange sense of justice, or some other personal goal, your path is often dark, grim, and solitary. One that most common folk would never have the guts to take, but that is the reason most warloks of the Dark Hunter choose this path.

In Tanares:
In the shadowy recesses of Tanares, warlocks of the Dark Hunter emerge as enigmatic figures, often misconstrued as perilous vigilantes. Yet, in reality, they are the unsung champions of the realm, selflessly risking their lives to shield the innocent and eradicate the malevolence that skulks in the shadows.
	Equipped with weapons infused with dark energies and wielding sinister magic to bolster their pursuit, these warlocks instill fear in their adversaries and command respect for their unparalleled expertise in tracking down monstrous beings. However, their notoriety as relentless aberration exterminators frequently engenders misunderstanding and suspicion from the masses.
	In truth, the warlocks of the Dark Hunter maintain their distance not due to their foreboding reputation, but because they recognize that proximity to others would only invite danger and suffering. Witnessing the ramifications of their actions and the wickedness they hunt, they opt to operate in solitude or as affiliates of the Celestianist Church to mitigate risks to those dear to them.
	Despite their solitary dispositions, these warlocks exhibit unwavering loyalty to their comrades, stopping at nothing to safeguard those they trust. As the vanguards of the innocent, they vanquish evil with calculated precision, employing darkness to combat darkness in a bid to restore equilibrium to the world. When peril looms, they are summoned to defend the innocent, responding with unshakeable resolve and courage.
	In a realm besieged by darkness and depravity, warlocks of the Dark Hunter are beacons of hope for the despondent and sanctuaries for the fearful. Though their path is fraught with shadow, desolation, and isolation, they stand as the steadfast guardians of Tanares, relentlessly battling to shield the world from the encroachment of evil.

Your patron is you in a decades-distant future. Perhaps your future self found an artifact of great power connecting them to the past, which they must now lead you to discover, or perhaps they were taught the mystic arts by their future self long ago, a cycle you will have to continue by teaching yourself someday. Your future self has forgotten the fine details of some things, and outright refuses to tell you about things you &#34;can&#39;t know yet,&#34; but offers compelling insight and guidance nonetheless. You&#39;re not quite sure what your future self is planning for your future (and for their past), but one thing is certain-they need you alive.

Future You Quirks:
Strange effects linger after communicating with your future self. You gain one of the following traits:

Future You Quirks:
d6 | Personality Traits
1 | You often speak in the wrong tense or refer to yourself in a plural.
2 | You sometimes refer to a person you just met by name, before they&#39;ve introduced themselves.
3 | Even in dire circumstances, you are unreasonably calm.
4 | In certain lighting, you look much older than you are.
5 | Seeing certain people alive can instantly reduce you to tears.
6 | Your future fashion sense clashes completely with that of today.

Rather than forging a pact inked by blood or bound to your soul, you have inherited a Legacy, a patron embodied by a line of inheritors sworn to a sacred cause. In so doing, you have acquired a relic of this ancient legacy, an object of unimaginable power passed down through the generations or recently uncovered from a long-lost civilization. With it, you can transform into the most powerful version of yourself to continue your Legacy&#39;s fight.
	Countless Legacies have imbued warlocks with ancient powers, and only a few remain today, but each possesses a unique type of relic and bestows a unique type of transformation. How you use this transformation is ultimately up to you, but the Legacy conspires to see you achieve greatness and advance its unknowable ancient goals.

Magical Girls and Superheroes:
Underneath its dramatic exterior, The Legacy patron draws inspiration from magical girl anime and superhero comics. Play a Legacy warlock to inject more anime tropes into your campaign, and to finally answer the question of how to play Sailor Moon in 5e.

	• You have a pool of battle dice, which are d6s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.

While transformed, you gain the following benefits:

The Flesh. When you aren&#39;t wearing armor, your base AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use The Flesh to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield&#39;s benefits apply as normal while you use The Flesh.

The Claws. You sprout a set of wicked claws, which you can use as natural melee weapons to make claw attacks. You are proficient with your claw attacks and can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength, for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, your claws deal 1d8 slashing damage, which counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, your claws count as pact weapons for warlock class features.

Extra Attack. Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice with your claws, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

	Spells cast in this way resemble the strange magic of hags, and may be unrecognizable to traditional spellcasters, though your spells can be dispelled and counterspelled as normal.

Once per day you may have a flash of inspiration, allowing you to build an insane gadget of unprecedented design. Using tinker&#39;s tools or smith&#39;s tools, you can spend 1 hour building the contraption in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you.
	Have your DM roll on the Crazy Contraption table, and then describe to you the resulting creation.

Crazy Contraptions:
d20 | Contraption | Properties

1 | Unstable Gadget:
This item is identical in appearance to one of the other contraptions, but faulty in its design. It will explode when a creature attempts to use it, dealing 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 lightning damage to the holder and any creatures within 5 feet of them.

2 | Shock Gauntlet:
You can use this item as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. While you are wearing the gauntlet, you may cast either Shocking Grasp or Lightning Lure as a bonus action on your turn.

3 | Laser Gun:
This item functions as a one-handed firearm with a range of 30/90. When rolling for attack with this weapon, use your Charisma modifier instead of your Dexterity. On a hit, the target takes radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.

4 | Electron Grenade:
This single-use item can be thrown up to 30 feet away as an action, detonating when it reaches the end of its trajectory. Upon detonation, it creates a 15-foot-radius sphere of whirling electricity which remains in place for 1 minute. All creatures inside the sphere when it appears, as well as any that enter or end their turn in it, take 2d8 lightning damage.

5 | Utility Gizmo:
This single-use item can be used to create a dramatic or specific effect, rather than causing damage. It might blast open an impenetrable wall, steal an object carried by an enemy, reactivate a fallen construct, or any other suitably dramatic effect that the DM approves.

6 | Telekinetic Glove:
While you are wearing this item, you may cast the Mage Hand cantrip without any components, and can make the spectral hand invisible. Additionally, you can use your bonus action to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved 5 feet toward or away from you.

7 | Slime Lasso:
This item functions in the same way as a whip, but counts as a simple weapon and deals acid damage instead. Whenever a creature is hit by it, they must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become grappled, taking 2d4 acid damage at the start of each of their turns. They can use their action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check, freeing themselves on a success. You must use one hand to hold the lasso and maintain the grapple, otherwise the target is freed.

8 | Dart Gun:
This item functions as a one-handed firearm with the Ammunition and Loading properties, a range of 20/60 and a total of 6 shots (2 for each dart type). On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage and must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering the dart&#39;s effect on a failed save. Sleeping darts: the target falls unconscious for 1 minute. Toxin darts: the target becomes poisoned for 1 hour. Shock darts: the target becomes stunned until the start of their next turn.

9 | Gravity Boots:
While you are wearing this item, your walking speed decreases by 10 feet, but you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings (while leaving your hands free). You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain.

10 | Mapping Radar:
This item has 4 charges, and can be activated as an action on your turn. When you do so, the device will emit sound waves audible out to 200 feet, creating a simplified map of your current location or environment by extracting information from the echoes reflected in its surroundings. This process takes a total of 1 minute, and will be interrupted if the radar takes any damage. The map covers a range of 120 feet, can be viewed for 10 minutes, and appears as a static visual effect on the radar&#39;s surface.

11 | Hoverplate:
This item functions as a single-person vehicle, which can be controlled by standing on it. While you are riding this vehicle, your speed becomes 100 feet and your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain; but you cannot use the Dash action. Additionally, if your Dexterity score is lower than 16, you must make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check each time you use it. You lose control of the hoverplate on a failed check, tumbling down on the ground and becoming prone.

12 | Hypno Goggles:
While you are wearing this item, you may cast the &#39;Friends&#39; cantrip as a bonus action on your turn without any components, and can choose a hostile creature as your target. Additionally, whenever you cast a spell from the Enchantment school of magic, you don&#39;t need to maintain concentration on it as long as you and the target maintain eye contact. If the spell is of 1st level or higher, you also gain a bonus to the Spell Save DC equal to half your Charisma modifier (rounded down).

13 | Volatile Gadget:
This item works in the same way as one of the other contraptions, but its energy cell is overcharged. Every time you take an action, bonus action or reaction which makes use of it, you must roll a d4. On a 1, you take 1d6 lightning damage. When you reach 9th level, this damage increases to 2d6.

14 | Holo-Shield:
This device has 8 charges, and may be strapped to your forearm or another limb of your choosing. It can be activated either as a bonus action or as a reaction to getting hit, generating a compact energy field which increases your AC by a number equal to your Charisma modifier, until the start of your next turn. You cannot wield a shield while you are wearing this item.

15 | Cantrip Powerizer:
You can use this item as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and it may be strapped to your forearm or another limb of your choosing. When you build this contraption, choose one cantrip from the warlock spell list. While you are wearing the Powerizer, you may cast that cantrip without material components. Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can energize one of your cantrips known. Whenever you cast that cantrip through the Powerizer, it deals an additional damage die. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you use it again.

16 | InfoBot:
This Tiny-sized construct has an AC of 10, a speed of 15 feet, and a number of hit points equal to three times your warlock level. It is immune to psychic and necrotic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 6 (-2). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It is friendly to you and your companions, and obeys your commands. You can activate the InfoBot&#39;s translation function as an action on your turn, as long as you are within 5 feet of it. Once activated, for the next minute it will be able to understand the literal meaning of any spoken language it hears, and may use its action to replicate those words in any language that its creator knows. Once this function has been used a total of 4 times, the InfoBot breaks down and becomes unusable.

17 | Zap-o-Matic:
This item has 4 charges, and may be strapped to your wrist, ankle, neck or forehead. It can be activated as a bonus action on your turn, zapping one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an ally, they must make a DC 10 Constitution check, regaining a number of hit points equal to your Charisma modifier on a success. If the target is a hostile creature, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, they lose concentration on any active spells or effects, and are unable to cast spells of 3rd level or higher until the end of their next turn.

18 | Swingshot:
This wrist-mounted gadget can be activated as an action on your turn, firing out a green energy cable from its antenna onto a target surface within 40 feet of you. Roll a d20. If the number rolled is a 10 or higher, the cable latches itself to the specified point, allowing you to swing across gaps or possibly climb steep walls. You can have the cable detach itself from a surface as a bonus action, returning it to your device. Additionally, you may choose to recall the cable without detaching it, pulling you towards the targeted surface before retracting completely. If the targeted surface is a Medium or smaller object, it is pulled towards you instead. If it is a Medium or smaller creature, they must make a Strength saving throw, being pulled towards you on a failed save and pulling you towards them on a successful one.

19 | Barely Stable Gadget:
This item works in the same way as one of the other contraptions, but its functionality is unreliable. Every time you take an action, bonus action or reaction which makes use of it, the DM must roll a d8. On a 1, the device malfunctions, completely losing its usability.

20 | Mustache-Inator:
This terrifying weapon of evil madness can be activated as an action on your turn, zapping one creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target instantly grows a big, bushy mustache measuring up to twice its body size. The affected creature must then roll a d20. On a 5 or lower, it gains a bonus of +5 to any Charisma ability checks it makes while having this facial hair on. The mustache lasts for 24 hours, after which it naturally falls out.

Once you create a contraption, you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a long rest, or until you expend a spell slot to create one; in which case the building time is reduced to 1 minute. Only one contraption can be active at a time, and you can&#39;t create another while your current one is present. You may dismantle your current contraption during the same hour spent on the creation of a new one. After 24 hours of use, your contraptions break down and become unusable.

As an action, you can target a computerized device within 30 feet of you. If the targeted device is held or otherwise actively used by a living creature, that creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the targeted device ceases to function until the end of your next turn. If the targeted device is not held or used by a creature, the DM makes a special saving throw for the device with disadvantage and a +0 modifier. Certain shielded devices might negate the disadvantage, at the DM&#39;s determination.
	Once you use this feature, you can&#39;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Your pact allows you to experience the barest touch of the raw stuff of life that powers the multiverse. Anything more, and you would be instantly incinerated by its energy.
	Contact with the Positive Plane causes subtle changes to your behavior and beliefs. You are driven to bring light to dark places, to annihilate undead creatures, and to protect all living things. At the same time, you crave the light and find total darkness a suffocating experience akin to drowning.
	As an optional way to add more flavor to your character, you can pick from or roll on the following table of flaws associated with warlocks of the Undying Light.

Undying Light Flaws:
d6 | Quirk
1 | You are afraid of the dark, and must always have a light source at hand.
2 | You have a nervous compulsion to keep a bright light in even the barest shadow.
3 | You have a compulsion to enter and illuminate dark areas.
4 | You have an overwhelming hatred of undead creatures.
5 | You fidget and are irritable when you can&#39;t see the sun.
6 | In a dark area, you always carry a lit torch or lantern. Putting it down is an unbearable thought.

In return for your patron&#39;s gifts, you wander the world seeking lore that you can share with the Seeker.
	Your patron could be any deity or other powerful entity dedicated to knowledge or forgotten lore. Celestian is an ideal patron for a Greyhawk campaign, and was the inspiration for this concept. In the Forgotten Realms, your patron might be Azuth or Oghma. Aureon makes an excellent patron in Eberron, while in Krynn and the Dragonlance campaign setting, Gilean is a good match for the Seeker&#39;s role.

The Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature&#39;s death and ensuring that it meets its end at the proscribed time and place. As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.
	The Raven Queen&#39;s followers are expected to serve her will in the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.

The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you.
	While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can&#39;t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can&#39;t take damage; and it is incapacitated.
	You can see through the raven&#39;s eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.
	The raven doesn&#39;t require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action. The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.
	At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you—no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.

As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle.
	When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold or lightning damage (your choice when it takes the damage) and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage dealt by the tentacle increases to 2d8.
	As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack. You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

For example, a kraken&#39;s warlock might summon great squid-like tentacles, serrated crab claws, or a massive octopus beak, while the servant of a primordial water elemental might create tendrils or swells of living water.

Upon selecting the Mage of Lorehold subclass, you gain two features: Lorehold Spells and Ancient Companion.
	In this subclass&#39;s features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass.

	Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can call forth and bond with one such spirit, who comes to inhabit a Medium, freestanding statue within 10 feet of you to serve as your ancient companion. See this creature&#39;s game statistics in the Ancient Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When you bond with your ancient companion, choose the type of spirit you bond with: Healer, Sage, or Warrior. Your choice of spirit determines certain traits in its stat block. The statue determines the spirit&#39;s appearance.
	The ancient companion is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. In combat, the companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
	As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended.
	The companion perishes when it drops to 0 hit points, when you bond with a new ancient companion at the end of a short or long rest, or when you die. When the companion perishes, the spirit within returns to its plane of origin, and the statue becomes an inert object.

Immediately after a creature you can see within 60 feet of you succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to demoralize the creature. Unless the creature is immune to being charmed, it rerolls the d20 and must use the lower roll. If the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw then fails, you can choose a different creature you can see within 60 feet of you (you can choose yourself). That creature is empowered, and can reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute and use the higher result. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this feature at a time.
	Once a creature fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw because of a reroll forced by this feature, you can&#39;t use the feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.

When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class&#39;s spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don&#39;t count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

You can choose the form that this spellcasting focus takes each time you create it. It can either be a Revolver or a Sniper (detailed below).
	Your hex gun disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss it (no action required), or if you die.
	Your hex gun acts as a spellcasting focus, and when you cast cantrips with it, it channels them as bullets (these still count as spells). Instead of increasing the damage of the cantrip when you reach certain levels, you can cast the cantrip additional times as part of the same action (except for Eldritch Blast, which is cast as normal). To be cast in this way, the cantrip must deal damage, must make a spell attack or require a saving throw, and must have a range other than self.
	When you cast a cantrip in this manner, you cast it 2 times at 5th level, 3 times at 11th level, and 4 times at 17th level. The cantrip can deal its damage more than once, but its other effects can&#39;t be applied again.

Revolver Form: Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn&#39;t impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls cast through the hex gun. While wielding this weapon, you know the shocking grasp cantrip.

Sniper Form: Your ranged spell attack rolls cast through the hex gun have their range doubled and ignore half-cover. While wielding this weapon, you know the ray of frost cantrip.

While wearing your pact cloak, you constantly float a few inches off the ground.

	Your pact aegis disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the aegis (no action required), or if you die.
	You can transform one magic shield OR one magic suit of armor into your pact aegis by performing a special ritual while you hold it. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the aegis, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact aegis thereafter. You can&#39;t affect an artifact or a sentient item in this way. The shield or armor ceases being your pact aegis if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different item, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it.

6 | Whenever someone looks at you, your nose seems to drift slowly to the side of your face but returns to its normal position when they blink.

Once per long rest you may spend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to build your device, choosing from the following options:

Killer Robot:
You can spend 1 minute building the robot in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can also choose to spend 1 hour on it instead, making it last for longer. Once created, the Killer Robot lasts for 1 hour if you spent 1 minute on it, or 8 hours if you spent 1 hour on it.
	The robot can take the form of any Large or smaller construct with a CR equal to or lower than 5. It has immunity to psychic and necrotic damage, in addition to the features given by its chosen form. It is friendly to you and your companions, and obeys your commands. During combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d8 hit points.
	The robot breaks down and becomes unusable if reduced to 0 hit points, unable to be healed or revived afterwards.

Death Ray:
You can spend 1 minute building a high-performance laser turret in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, which lasts for up to 1 hour. The turret is a Medium-sized cannon, with an AC of 20 and a number of hit points equal to five times your warlock level. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 14 (+2). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d4 hit points.
	You can activate the turret as an action on your turn, as long as you are within 5 feet of it. Once activated, it fires off a beam of searing light against a target within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, if the target has 80 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, it takes 5d6 radiant damage and 5d6 fire damage. The Death Ray ignores the damage threshold of objects and structures, always dealing maximum damage to them.
	You can fire off the ray a number of times equal to half your Charisma modifier (rounded up). Once the number of shots is expended, the ray hits a living creature, or the turret is reduced to 0 hit points, the turret then completely breaks down and becomes unusable.

Bioweapon Beast:
You can spend 1 minute transforming the corpse of a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of you into your bioweapon. You can also choose to spend 1 hour on it instead, making it last for longer. Once created, the Bioweapon Beast lasts for 1 hour if you spent 1 minute on it, or 8 hours if you spent 1 hour on it.
	The bioweapon can be any beast of the same size as the corpse with a CR equal to or lower than 6. It has immunity to acid and poison damage, in addition to the features given by its chosen form. During combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. It is hostile to all creatures, including you, and will pursue and attack the nearest targets to the best of its ability.
	If the bioweapon is reduced to 0 hit points, its body breaks down into a pool of acid, unable to be healed or revived afterwards.

Explodium Bomb:
You can spend 1 minute building a Large-sized missile launch pad in a 10-foot square unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, which lasts for up to 10 minutes. It has an AC of 16 and a number of hit points equal to three times your warlock level. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d4 hit points.
	You can initiate the launching sequence as an action on your turn, as long as you are within 5 feet of it. Once activated, the structure takes one round to load the warhead, launching it to the sky at the start of your next turn. The sequence is interrupted if the launch pad takes any damage.
	Once successfully launched, one round later at the start of your following turn, the missile comes down at a point of your choice within 200 feet of you, generating an explosion of insensible proportions. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on the specified point must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 lightning damage per warlock level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The blast damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.
	Once the Explodium Bomb is launched, or the launch pad is reduced to 0 hit points, the launch pad then completely breaks down and becomes unusable.

You and up to 5 willing creatures of your choice that you can see are grasped by tentacles that emerge from the portal. A second portal opens at a point of your choice within 100 miles that you have visited within the past 24 hours. A second portal opens, depositing you and your chosen allies there.

Fury:
The tentacles slam onto your foes. Pick up to 5 creatures that you can see within 30 feet of the portal. Those creatures must make Dexterity saving throws against your warlock spell save DC. Creatures that fail their saving throw take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and are restrained for 1 minute. Those that succeed take half the bludgeoning damage and are not restrained. On its turn, a restrained creature can use its action to attempt a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to end the restrained condition.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

A creature charmed by you has disadvantage on its saving throw. After you use this ability, you cannot cast it again until you complete a long rest.

Folk Hero Origins:
d6 | Origin
1 | You helped get healing for a sick child. Now the sick come to you, knowing you&#39;ll help them find a way to salvation.
2 | You helped break a Guild protection racket afflicting a community of immigrants in the Outer City. Now, you can&#39;t travel through that part of the city without your dozen adopted grandparents inviting you in for a meal.
3 | Seeing a lost patriar after dark in the Outer City, you guided the wayward noble through back streets to safety. The patriar repaid your help by paying for improved roofs and lamps in your neighborhood, causing the entire community to celebrate your deed.
4 | Fueled by alcohol, you faced down a carrion crawler that slunk out of the sewer, knocking it out with a single punch. Since then, however, the ale you once credited with your heroism has drowned it, and even your most patient admirers are losing hope. You&#39;re hoping for one last chance to win back the goodwill you&#39;ve drunk away.
5 | You once defeated a raging bugbear with a hand mirror, a mounted deer&#39;s head, and two kicks to the groin. Later, you and the bugbear became friends.
6 | Last winter, you dove into the frigid river to haul out a foundering fishing boat with your bare hands, saving all aboard. Now, everyone on the docks knows your name.</text></feat><feat><name>Specialty</name><text>You previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, woodcutter, or gravedigger.

Defining Event:
d10 | Defining Event
1 | I stood up to a tyrant&#39;s agents.
2 | I saved people during a natural disaster.
3 | I stood alone against a terrible monster.

5 | I led a militia to fight off an invading army.
6 | I broke into a tyrant&#39;s castle and stole weapons to arm the people.
7 | I trained the peasantry to use farming implements as weapons against a tyrant&#39;s soldiers.
8 | A lord rescinded an unpopular decree after I led a symbolic act of protest against it.
9 | A celestial, fey, or similar creature gave me a blessing or revealed my secret origin.
10 | Recruited into a lord&#39;s army, I rose to leadership and was commended for my heroism.</text></feat><feat><name>Suggested Characteristics</name><text>A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse.

1 | I have a family, but I have no idea where they are. One day, I hope to see them again.
2 | I worked the land, I love the land, and I will protect the land.
3 | A proud noble once gave me a horrible beating, and I will take my revenge on any bully I encounter.
4 | My tools are symbols of my past life, and I carry them so that I will never forget my roots.
5 | I protect those who cannot protect themselves.
6 | I wish my childhood sweetheart had come with me to pursue my destiny.

d6 | Flaw
1 | The tyrant who rules my land will stop at nothing to see me killed.

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

While he has done great deeds for the Coast’s people, the source of his power remains secret. The cambion Mizora drew Wyll into a warlock’s pact in a moment with many lives at stake, and cursed him with the duty of hunting her enemies. Mizora only asks Wyll to sacrifice devilish creatures to her, but a cambion’s ambitions are ever fickle, and Wyll wishes to escape the pact before its price grows cruel.
