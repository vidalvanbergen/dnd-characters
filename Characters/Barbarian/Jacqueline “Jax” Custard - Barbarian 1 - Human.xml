Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that&#39;s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a barbarian.

	• Strength 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class&#39;s starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a barbarian.

	• Armor: shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

Source:	Player&#39;s Handbook (2014) p. 163</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Multiclass Features</name><text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don&#39;t, however, receive the class&#39;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you&#39;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn&#39;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don&#39;t add together. You can&#39;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter&#39;s version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock&#39;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn&#39;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can&#39;t gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don&#39;t have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don&#39;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

Exhaustion:
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect&#39;s description.

Exhaustion Levels:
Level | Effect
1 | Disadvantage on ability checks
2 | Speed halved
3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4 | Hit point maximum halved
5 | Speed reduced to 0
6 | Death

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect&#39;s description.
	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.
	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect&#39;s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature&#39;s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature&#39;s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature&#39;s exhaustion level by 1.

These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Sacred Kin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spellcasting Ability:
Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to harness the magic in your blood. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spell casting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast or when making an attack roll with one.

If one ends up face to face against such a monster, there is no running away—they will catch you, electrocute you, and rend your corpse. Although vital in the fight against the Scourge, their recklessness causes fear in the heart of friends and foes alike.
	The Scions created the Lightning Vessels, using galvanized rods implanted within the spine of newborns, before subjecting them to violent shock therapy. Of those children, a few grew capable of harnessing lightning, while many more were crippled for life—a small price to pay for salvation. This very technology was later used to create the Galvanized Prowlers, mortal enemies of the Lightning Vessels, as the Scions started fearing their own creation.

	In addition, while raging, you can unleash the lightning within. For the duration of your rage, you can use your bonus action to unleash various powers.

Saving Throws. Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Vessel save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

	• Electrified Chains. You can use your bonus action to create chains of lightning that wrap around your weapon. The next time you hit a creature this turn, it takes additional lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier and becomes ensnared by the chains, which anchor to the floor, until the start of your next turn. Each time it attempts to move more than 10 feet while ensnared, it must make an Athletics check contested by your Athletics check, freeing itself on a success. On a failure, it takes the lightning damage again and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

	• Fulgurant Strike. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can leave the weapon embedded in their chest for a brief moment and immediately use a bonus action to call down lightning from the heavens to strike them, using the weapon as a conduit, before retrieving it. The target takes lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier, and all creatures within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Vessel save DC or also take that damage. You have advantage on this saving throw.

	• Lightning Step. As a bonus action, you can move up to half your speed. During this rush, your body becomes supercharged; if you end this movement within 5 feet of a creature, it takes lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier as the lightning leaps to them. If there are multiple creatures, choose one that takes the damage.

Among them, the Earthbreakers stand imperious; barbarians with a natural affinity for the void, capable of leveling buildings in their rage, these living titans are coveted prizes. Many factions seek to bend their wills for their own ends, and if such control proves impossible, death is an all too frequent outcome.
	Whether from innate talent, intense training, or cursed rituals, all Earthbreakers share the same path of destruction, crushing their foes and grinding them to dust. Earthbreakers thrive in the middle of the battlefield, where they break their enemies, drag their face on the pavement, and leave behind naught but a mess of blood and brain. It is pointless to hide from them, for they are capable of shattering the very foundations of the world to unearth their quarry. The power to reshape the world—to bend and break it at a whim—is one many desire, yet few master it like Earthbreakers do.

If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone. If the target isn&#39;t on the ground when it fails this save, it immediately falls instead, even if it can hover.

	• Bulldozing Punch. You push the target 10 feet away from you or upward. If pushed into an obstacle or another creature, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1).

This rite is highly regarded within their tribes and serves as a way to prove one&#39;s worth, attain prestige, or face shame.
	Fueled by a burning desire to demonstrate their strength to themselves, their tribe, or their enemies, the Brutal Hunters relentlessly pursue their targets with unyielding fervor. They may hunt for revenge against those who have wronged them, eliminate enemies, or prove their dominance over powerful creatures, making them trophies to add to their collection.
	Brutal Hunters take immense pride in their hunting trophies, viewing them as a symbol of their strength and prowess. Their collection of teeth from their fallen prey is a source of great respect among their peers and serves as a testament to their power.

You determine its appearance, but this choice has no effect on its game statistics. Common Savage Companions are wolves, boars, bears, wildcats, and hyenas. Your Companion is friendly to you and your allies, and obeys your commands. It uses the Savage Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
	In combat, your Savage Companion acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use a bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block, or another action.
	When you take the Attack action, you can command your Companion to take the Attack action in place of one attack.
	If you are incapacitated, your Companion acts on its own. If your Companion is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. If your Savage Companion dies, you can spend time during a long rest to seek out a worthy beast from the surrounding wilds to serve as your Savage Companion, so long as such a beast exists. Once you find and bond with such a wild beast, it uses the Savage Companion stat block.

Cantrips:
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Warden spell list. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional Warden cantrip of your choice.

Spell Slots:
The Warden Primal Magic table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of the Warden spells you know of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots each time you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, when you are 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warden spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warden Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warden spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&#39;s shown in the table&#39;s Slot Level column for your level.
	When you gain a level, you can choose a warden spell you know and replace it with another spell from the warden spell list, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new Warden spell of your choice, which can be 1st or 2nd-level.

Spellcasting Ability:
As you draw your magic from your connection to primal spirits, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells. You use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spell, or when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Desert. Any enemy that ends its turn in your aura takes fire damage equal to 2 + your barbarian level divided by 4.

Sea. At the end of each of your turns, you can choose a creature in your aura other than yourself.

However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don&#39;t die until your rage ends.

When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). Until your rage ends, the chosen creatures gain the Reckless Attack feature and you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. You also gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts the benefit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment — perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club.

At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure.

1 | Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. (Good)
2 | Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we are. (Lawful)
3 | Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)
4 | Greed. I&#39;m only in it for the money and fame. (Evil)
5 | People. I like seeing the smiles on people&#39;s faces when I perform. That&#39;s all that matters. (Neutral)

6 | Despite my best efforts, I am unreliable to my friends.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><proficiency>100</proficiency><proficiency>112</proficiency></background>
