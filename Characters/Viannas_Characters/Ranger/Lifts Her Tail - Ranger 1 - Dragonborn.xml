Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

Source:	Player&#39;s Handbook (2014) p. 32</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Proud Dragon Kin</name><text>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are smiting, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.
	The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor-bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic like gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Self-Sufficient Clans</name><text>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn&#39;s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.
	A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency, of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of that particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.
	Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a client needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races or even from the gods.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Dragonborn Names</name><text>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutch mates as a descriptive term or endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.

They live to be around 80.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Alignment</name><text>Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Size</name><text>Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a ranger.

	• Dexterity 13
	• Wisdom 13

Proficiencies Gained:

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none
	• Skills: Choose 1 from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth and Survival.

Source:	Player&#39;s Handbook (2014) p. 89</text><optional>1</optional></feat><feat><name>Multiclass Features</name><text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don&#39;t, however, receive the class&#39;s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you&#39;re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn&#39;t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don&#39;t add together. You can&#39;t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter&#39;s version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock&#39;s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn&#39;t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can&#39;t gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don&#39;t have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don&#39;t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.

Spell Slots:
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Many Deep Stalkers are elves, as those folk know all too well the threat posed by the drow. Deep Stalkers scout for new passages into the Underdark, carefully mapping them and working to ensure they remain watched at all times. They venture into the depths on long, dangerous patrols, disappearing for months at a time. Many of them never return.
	Deep Stalkers master spells useful in navigating the Underdark, and their combat tactics focus on ambush, surprise, and stealth. They fight alone or in small groups in hostile territory, relying on clever tactics to carry the day.

It&#39;s Your Swarm:
A Swarmkeeper&#39;s swarm and spells are reflections of the character&#39;s bond with nature spirits. Take the opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger&#39;s magic in play. For example, when your ranger casts gaseous form, they might appear to melt into the swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the arcane eye spell could create an extension of your swarm that spies for you. Such descriptions don&#39;t change the effects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to explore your character&#39;s narrative through their class abilities. For more guidance on customizing spells, see the &#34;Personalizing Spells&#34; section in chapter 3.
	Also, remember that the swarm&#39;s appearance is yours to customize, and don&#39;t feel confined to a single appearance. Perhaps the spirits&#39; look changes with the ranger&#39;s mood or with the seasons. You decide!

Details of these traps can be found in the &#39;Ranger Traps&#39; spell list.

Physical Traps. Creating a physical trap takes 1 hour (which can be done during a short or long rest) and uses trap-making materials (valued in gp) specified in the trap&#39;s description. After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the trap can&#39;t be used again. However, over the course of 10 minutes, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap&#39;s construction if it hasn&#39;t activated yet.

Magical Traps. Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the &#34;Ranger Traps&#34; spell list. Some of these traps require you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.

While a physical trap&#39;s description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to 30 feet. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate a magical trap within 150 feet of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).

Trapper Traps:
Ranger Level | Trap Options
3rd | bear trap, snare trap, sole striker
5th | immolation, miasma, soul bin, pit trap
9th | bewilderment, net trap, thunder charge
13th | catapult trap, infection, snapfrost
17th | banisher, gravity well

Deploying a Trap. As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures. Over the course of 1 minute, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your ranger save DC and succeeds.

Disarming a Trap. Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a Dexterity (thieves&#39; tools) check (for physical traps) or a spellcasting ability (Arcana) check (for magical traps) against your ranger save DC. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap&#39;s effects. As an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within 150 feet of you.

Trap Effects. Spell effects created by a trap don&#39;t require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within 40 feet of the centre of another magical trap fails.

Trained by prestigious noble houses, arcane schools, or remote temples, these elite warriors are experts in suppressing and punishing the misuse of magic and eliminating magical creatures that wreak havoc on the lives of the common folk.
	Arcane Guardians are not your typical rangers. They possess knowledge of both wizard spells and ranger spells, granting them a powerful advantage in combating magical dangers. They have honed their skills in magic manipulation and resistance, and have learned to draw upon their inner reserves to unleash spells that surpass their normal capabilities. Their weapons are imbued with mystical energy that disrupts the magic of their foes, causing immense pain with each strike.
	Many Arcane Guardians are created through alchemical processes or magic rituals, either voluntarily to protect their people or through forced experimentation. Regardless of their origin, they possess a versatility that sets them apart from other rangers, including access to more aggressive spells. Whether hunting specific creatures or patrolling as protectors against megalomaniacal spellcasters and dangerous magical artifacts, Arcane Guardians are always ready to face the unknown and defend the innocent from the perils of magic. These fearless warriors embody the true spirit of a ranger, fearlessly facing danger and steadfastly defending civilization.

Arcane Guardian in Tanares:
	In Tanares, magic is as revered as it is feared. It has brought both marvels and disasters, such as the downfall of the once-prosperous Mystical Kingdom, which was destroyed by a Malrokian Curse. Society&#39;s fear of magic and mages led Emperor Baleroth to dedicate resources towards controlling and restricting the use of arcane powers.
	To protect the Tanarean Empire from magical threats, special groups were created to study and combat arcane magic. These Arcane Guardians underwent rigorous training and mystical experiments to hone their sensitivity to magical energies and track them. Many of them harbor a deep-seated hatred for the indiscriminate use of magic, either due to the Empire&#39;s manipulative training or because of the atrocities they suffered during their training. Regardless of their motivations, they treat magic users with suspicion and instability.
	Over time, some of these soldiers discovered that not all of the targets they hunted were truly dangerous conjurers. Many were merely political pawns, leading some Guardians to question their orders and seek a way out of the Imperial forces. Those who managed to desert and survive became mercenaries, adventurers, or reclusive hermits, always evading the reach of the Empire&#39;s agents.
	With the formation of the Magocracy of Mage Tower, many of these previously hidden rangers were invited to join a special force of arcane combatants, serving as part of the Magocracy&#39;s guard and army. Others took advantage of the Empire&#39;s diminished influence to live freely in the Republic or other nations beyond its reach.

In response, the Shadow Investigator has emerged, possessing the skills and intuition necessary to swiftly detect and eliminate these malevolent beings.
	Through their extensive network of connections and their keen senses, the Shadow Investigator gathers information, analyzes affected locations, and identifies their targets with precision. Their mastery of the enemy and their tactics, honed through extensive training in fighting the penumbral threat, allows for efficient and effective operations. Whether it&#39;s hunting down penumbral creatures or targeting sinister cultists, the Shadow Investigator is determined to root out evil at its source.
	Despite their unconventional methods, the Shadow Investigator remains a critical component in the ongoing struggle against the penumbral menace. They keep their knowledge close to the vest, sharing it only with trusted pupils or assistants, but their mastery of the enemy and their tactics make them an indispensable force in the fight. Though their methods may engender distrust or fear among the general population, the Shadow Investigator is a necessary presence in the ongoing battle against the penumbral threat.

In Other Settings:
The Shadow Investigator subclass can be an excellent addition to any setting, providing a great asset to any group with their skills in detecting and eliminating malevolent creatures or individuals.
	Although the Shadow Investigator&#39;s skills were honed for detecting and fighting penumbral creatures in Tanares, they can be adapted to track and eliminate any creature that threatens the safety of a town or city. Their unorthodox methods and social outcast status may cause distrust or fear among the population, but their dedication to rooting out evil at its source is paramount to keeping people safe.
	Whether in a high-fantasy or low-fantasy setting, Shadow Investigators can be employed to track and eliminate a wide range of creatures. For example, in a high-fantasy setting, they could track and eliminate evil wizards and magical creatures, while in a low-fantasy setting, they could hunt down thieves and other criminals that threaten the safety of a town or city. Shadow Investigators can be changed to be trained to track any creature that permeates human society and stalks the night, such as vampires, ghouls, doppelgangers, demons, and devils.
	The Shadow Investigator is a social outcast detective or monster hunter that walks in the shadows to track and remove the evil creatures that stalk at night. Players should discuss with their GM the most interesting creature types to track and eliminate for their campaign. With their unique set of skills and abilities, Shadow Investigators are an adaptable subclass that can be integrated into any campaign.

After triggering an effect that activates when you are reduced to 0 hit points, that effect can&#39;t trigger again until you finish a long rest.

Defibrillate. Once per turn, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger an electrical discharge (no action required). The creature is unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn unless it is immune to lightning damage, and you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. After you move using this feature, you can&#39;t do so again until the start of your next turn.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you can instead drop to 1 hit point and immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn.

Dissolve. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a spurt of acid to coat its weapon or limb (no action required). If the melee attack was a spell attack or made with a natural weapon, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage. If the result of the attack roll meets your AC and is made with a ferrous, non-magical, non-natural weapon, the acid causes the metal to weaken and the weapon is destroyed.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points, all your concealed acid charges gush outward. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and an additional 5d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute until it uses an action to wipe itself clean. In addition, on a failure, if the creature rolled a 1 on the d20 for its saving throw and is wearing nonmagical, ferrous armor, the armor seizes. While wearing the armor, the creature&#39;s speed is halved, its AC is reduced by 2, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Entomb. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a burst of cold that ripples along the attacker&#39;s limb (no action required). The creature takes 1d4 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 15 feet until the end of its next turn unless it is immune to cold damage.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you become entombed in a block of clear ice that has AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. This icy block lasts for 1 minute or until it is destroyed. While the ice persists, you have total cover against all effects and you don&#39;t make death saving throws. If you regain 1 or more hit points, the icy block melts at the start of your next turn.

Self-Destruct. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can cause a small, shaped charge to detonate (no action required). You take 1 fire damage and the creature takes 1d8 fire damage.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you erupt in an immense ball of fire and immediately fail one death saving throw. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. A creature takes 14d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You&#39;ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
	You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life?

	• Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
	• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, thieves&#39; tools
	• Equipment: A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.

Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see &#34;Improvised Weapons&#34;).

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&#39;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#39;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&#39;t attack a target beyond the weapon&#39;s long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon&#39;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.
