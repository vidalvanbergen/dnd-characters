You can&#39;t duplicate the appearance of a creature you&#39;ve never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.

You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can&#39;t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you&#39;re bipedal, you can&#39;t use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don&#39;t change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.

Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#39;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you&#39;re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

While adventuring on that line, some rogues discover a mystical connection to death itself. These rogues take knowledge from the dead and become immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming like ghosts. Thieves&#39; guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers and spies.

Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters of these macabre techniques, and some are willing to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgotten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can become a wizard&#39;s confidant and right hand. In temples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as an agent to track down those who try to cheat death and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be lost to the grave.

How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or thieves&#39; guild dedicated to a deity of death?

In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of thieves&#39; guilds, though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.

Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk the path of the Soulknife, serving as silent, lethal guardians of their woods. In the endless war among the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a Soulknife when stealth is required against the githyanki foe.

As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since you were a child, only revealing their full potential as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.

In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can&#39;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.

You harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6.

Psionic Talent Options
You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:

Psi-Bolstered Knack.

	• When your non-psionic training fails you, you can tap into your psionic power to help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success.

Psychic Whispers.

	• You can use your psychic abilities to establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, you give yourself and at least one other creature the ability to speak telepathically with each other. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to the number rolled. For 1 hour, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can&#39;t use this telepathy if it can&#39;t speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don&#39;t need to speak a common language to understand each other.


Changing the Die&#39;s Size
If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it&#39;s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.

Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.

Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels in this class, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

Psi Replenishment
As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can&#39;t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.

Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters of these macabre techniques, and some are willing to teach this path. In places like Thay (Forgotten Realms) and Karrnath (Eberron), where many necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can become a wizard&#39;s confidant and right hand. In temples of gods of death, the Phantom works as an agent to track down those who try to cheat death and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be lost to the grave.

As an action while you have at least one Psychic Blade manifested, you can force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make an Intelligence saving throw (DC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). If you are hidden from the target, it has disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target takes 12d6 psychic damage, and it is stunned until the start of your next turn.

</text><expanded>0</expanded></feat><feat><name>Suggested Characteristics</name><text>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

d8 — Personality Trait
1 — I always have a plan for when things go wrong.
2 — I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
3 — The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden.
4 — I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
5 — I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
6 — I don&#39;t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.
7 — The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can&#39;t do it.
8 — I blow up at the slightest insult.

d6 — Ideal
1 — Honor. I don&#39;t steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)
2 — Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)
3 — Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)
4 — Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)
5 — People. I&#39;m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral)
6 — Redemption. There&#39;s a spark of good in everyone. (Good)

d6 — Bond
1 — I&#39;m trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.
2 — My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.
3 — Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.
4 — I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.
5 — I&#39;m guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.
6 — Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.

d6 — Flaw
1 — When I see something valuable, I can&#39;t think about anything but how to steal it.
2 — When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
3 — If there&#39;s a plan, I&#39;ll forget it. If I don&#39;t forget it, I&#39;ll ignore it.
4 — I have a &#39;tell&#39; that reveals when I&#39;m lying.
5 — I turn tail and run when things look bad.
6 — An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I&#39;m okay with that.

Additionally, the Crafting and Harvesting Poison rules require the use of a poisoner&#39;s kit.

A poisoner&#39;s kit is a favored resource for thieves, assassins, and others who engage in skulduggery. It allows you to apply poisons and create them from various materials. Your knowledge of poisons also helps you treat them.

Components: A poisoner&#39;s kit includes glass vials, a mortar and pestle, chemicals, and a glass stirring rod.

History: Your training with poisons can help you when you try to recall facts about infamous poisonings.

Investigation, Perception: Your knowledge of poisons has taught you to handle those substances carefully, giving you an edge when you inspect poisoned objects or try to extract clues from events that involve poison.

Medicine: When you treat the victim of a poison, your knowledge grants you added insight into how to provide the best care to your patient.

Nature, Survival: Working with poisons enables you to acquire lore about which plants and animals are poisonous.

Handle Poison: Your proficiency allows you to handle and apply a poison without risk of exposing yourself to its effects.

Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.

The perfect tool for anyone who wants to engage in trickery, a disguise kit enables its owner to adopt a false identity.

Components: A disguise kit includes cosmetics, hair dye, small props, and a few pieces of clothing.

Deception: In certain cases, a disguise can improve your ability to weave convincing lies.

Intimidation: The right disguise can make you look more fearsome, whether you want to scare someone away by posing as a plague victim or intimidate a gang of thugs by taking the appearance of a bully.

Performance: A cunning disguise can enhance an audience&#39;s enjoyment of a performance, provided the disguise is properly designed to evoke the desired reaction.

Persuasion: Folk tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts to persuade others are often more effective.

Create Disguise: As part of a long rest, you can create a disguise. It takes you 1 minute to don such a disguise once you have created it. You can carry only one such disguise on you at a time without drawing undue attention, unless you have a bag of holding or a similar method to keep them hidden. Each disguise weighs 1 pound.

At other times, it takes 10 minutes to craft a disguise that involves moderate changes to your appearance, and 30 minutes for one that requires more extensive changes.
